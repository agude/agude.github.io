{%- comment %}
If the include is broken across multiple lines, sometimes the title has \n
charters in it and we need to remove them. But the only way to get a newline
in liquid is to capture it (it doesn't understand \n).
{% endcomment -%}
{%- capture newline %}
{% endcapture -%}

{%- assign title = null -%}

{%- comment %}Try to find the page and set a URL.

We have to combine a lot of different collections to get all the pages on the
site.{% endcomment -%}
{%- assign pages = site.pages | where_exp: "item", "item.title" -%}
{%- assign books = site.books -%}
{%- assign posts = site.posts -%}

{%- assign all_pages = pages | concat: books | concat: posts -%}

{%- for p in all_pages -%}
  {%- if p.url == include.url -%}
