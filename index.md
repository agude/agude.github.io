# Hi there!

I'm **Alex Gude**, a data scientist with a passion for plots and algorithms,
as well as cycling and photography. I got my start in the tech industry at
[Insight Data Science][insight], after previously
working as a high energy particle physicist at CERN and a
[cosmologist][scp] at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.

I write about whatever catches my attention [here on this site][blog]; mostly
that means data science, machine learning, deep learning, and software
development. My writings on deep learning from my time at Lab41 can be found
at [Gab41][gab41] and [rehosted on this page][lab41_posts].

## Recent Writings

I write [**articles**][blog] about machine learning, data science, and
technology, as well as [**book reviews**][books]. You can find a sample of my
