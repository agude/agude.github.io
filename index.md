# Hi there!

I'm **Alex Gude**, a data scientist with a passion for plots and algorithms,
but also cycling and photography. I got my start in the valley at [Insight
Data Science][insight]. In my previous life, I was a high energy particle
physicist at CERN and a [cosmologist][scp] at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.

I write about whatever catches my attention [here on this site][blog]; mostly
that means data science, machine learning, deep learning, and software
development related topics. My writings on deep learning from my time at Lab41
can be found at [Gab41][gab41] and [rehosted on this page][lab41_posts]. If
you're interested in my thoughts in real time (as well as sneak peaks at what
I'm writing), follow me at _@{{ site.author.twitter }}_ on <a rel="me"
