# Hi there!

I'm **Alex Gude**, a machine learning engineer with a passion for plots and
algorithms, as well as cycling and photography. I got my start in the tech
industry at [Insight Data Science][insight], after previously working as a
high energy particle physicist at CERN and a [cosmologist][scp] at Lawrence
Berkeley Labs.

I write about whatever catches my attention [here on this site][blog]; mostly
that means data science, machine learning, deep learning, and software
development. Follow me on <a rel="me" href="https://bsky.app/profile/{{
site.author.bluesky }}">BlueSky</a> for real-time thoughts, and check out my
<a rel="me" href="https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}">Github page</a>
for code---bug reports and pull requests are always welcome!
