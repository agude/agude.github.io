  All of the articles written by Alex Gude for Lab41's blog on Deep Learning,
  Machine Learning, and Data Science.

I worked at Lab41 from 2015 and 2017. Part of my job was to write articles for
our blog, [**Gab41 blog**][gab41]. I covered some of the projects I worked on,
but my favorite and most popular posts were for the **reading group series**
where I reviewed some key papers in deep learning.
