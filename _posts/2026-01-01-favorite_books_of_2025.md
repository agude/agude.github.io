  side, showing their spines and page edges. The books are richly decorated
  with embossed floral and geometric patterns, worn leather bindings, and
  visible aging. One book has a small handwritten label on its spine, and
  another is secured with a metal clasp. The overall appearance suggests
  antique or historical volumes.

{% capture disco %}{% book_link "Disco Elysium" %}{% endcapture %}

I read 45 books last year, and 1 computer game ({{ disco }}) last year

## <cite class="book-title">Disco Elysium</cite>

"{{ disco }} isn't a book Alex!" Ok, sure, but it is one of the literary
masterpieces of the 21st century. It does a miraculous job of immersing the
player in the world, of exploring the grip the past has on the present, and
creating some of the deepest and most-developed characters in any medium. It
is my favorite game of all time, and one of my favorite literary works.

## The <span class="book-series">Hyperion Cantos</span> by <span class="author-name">Dan Simmons</span>

{% capture hyp %}{% book_link "Hyperion" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture fall %}{% book_link "The Fall of Hyperion" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture cantos %}{% series_link "Hyperion Cantos" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture simmons %}{% author_link "Dan Simmons" link_text="Simmons" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture keatss %}{% author_link "John Keats" possessive %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture hyperion3 %}{% book_link "Endymion" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture hyperion4 %}{% book_link "The Rise of Endymion" %}{% endcapture %}

I didn't love the {{ cantos }} the first time I read it. I found {{ fall }},
the easier, more straightforward of the two, to be great, but didn't really
get {{ hyp }}. This year I re-read them for my book club and focused on
finding and understanding the influences from {{ keatss }} works. It
completely transformed the experience! I **LOVED** {{ hyp }}, viewing it as a
new masterpiece of the genre. This year I'll be tackling {{ hyperion3 }} and
{{ hyperion4 }}, which I've heard don't live up to the greatness of the first,
but still I hope!

## <cite class="book-title">The Hydrogen Sonata</cite> by <span class="author-name">Iain M. Banks</span>

{% capture banks_full %}{% author_link "Iain M. Banks" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture banks %}{% author_link "Iain M. Banks" link_text="Banks" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture bankss %}{% author_link "Iain M. Banks" link_text="Banks" possessive %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture sonata %}{% book_link "The Hydrogen Sonata" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture culture %}{% series_link "Culture" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture phlebas %}{% book_link "Consider Phlebas" %}{% endcapture %}

{{ bankss }} {{ culture }} series was one of my [favorite reads in
2024][fav_2024]. I delayed finishing the series in 2024, spacing out the last
few books because I knew that once I'd finished, it was over for good. {{
sonata }} was a fitting end to the series, as it both restates the themes {{
banks }} first explored in the first book, {{ phlebas }}, but with a hopeful
bent. And a fitting final book for {{ banks_full }}, with its message that
life only has the meaning you give it.

## The <span class="book-series">Teixcalaan</span> series by <span class="author-name">Arkady Martine</span>

{% capture memory %}{% book_link "A Memory Called Empire" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture peace %}{% book_link "A Desolation Called Peace" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture teixcalaan %}{% series_link "Teixcalaan" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture martine %}{% author_link "Arkady Martine" link_text="Martine" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture martines %}{% author_link "Arkady Martine" link_text="Martine" possessive %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture wolfes %}{% author_link "Gene Wolfe" possessive %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture botns %}{% series_link "The Book of the New Sun" %}{% endcapture %}

Another pair of books picked by my book club, I enjoyed {{ martines }} subtle
worldbuilding and deep integration of themes and motifs in {{ memory }} and {{
peace }}. The writing was also beautiful, reminding me of {{ wolfes }} {{
botns }} with its mix of archaic prose and intentional vagueness.

## <span class="book-series">The Murderbot Diaries</span> by <span class="author-name">Martha Wells</span>


{% capture art_cond %}{% book_link "Artificial Condition" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture rogue %}{% book_link "Rogue Protocol" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture exit %}{% book_link "Exit Strategy" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture net_eff %}{% book_link "Network Effect" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture murderbot %}{% series_link "The Murderbot Diaries" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture wells %}{% author_link "Martha Wells" link_text="Wells" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture wellss %}{% author_link "Martha Wells" link_text="Wells" possessive %}{% endcapture %}

Everyone loves {{ murderbot }} and I am no exception. {{ wellss }} has the
perfect mix of pulpy action, fast pacing, memorable characters, but with deep
philosophical themes around what it means to be a person. I have a few more to
go this year, and I'm looking forward to them! I expect to see them in my 2026
list.

## <cite class="book-title">There Is No Antimemetics Division</cite> by <span class="author-name">qntm</span>

{% capture antimeme %}{% book_link "There Is No Antimemetics Division" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture original %}{% book_link "There Is No Antimemetics Division (Original Edition)" link_text="original edition" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture qntm %}{% author_link "qntm" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture qntms %}{% author_link "qntm" possessive %}{% endcapture %}

I read {{ qntms }} {{ original }} edition in 2023 and thought that it was
packed full of amazing ideas but was let down by a poorly written second act.
His rewrite this year fixed every single problem and leaves a book that will
make you think. Highly recommend!

## <cite class="book-title">A Mote in Shadow</cite> by <span class="author-name">A. N. Alex</span>

{% capture mote %}{% book_link "A Mote in Shadow" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture alex %}{% author_link "A. N. Alex" link_text="Alex" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture alexs %}{% author_link "A. N. Alex" link_text="Alex" possessive %}{% endcapture %}

I found this book when my corner of BlueSky started talking about it. I'm glad
I did because {{ alexs }} debut novel is a fantastic mix of hard sci-fi and
techno-thriller set in a fractured human civilization in the not-to-distant
future. He is working on the sequel, and I'm looking forward to it!
