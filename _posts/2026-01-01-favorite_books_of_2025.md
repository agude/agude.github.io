{% capture disco %}{% book_link "Disco Elysium" %}{% endcapture %}

Last year I reviewed 45 books and 1 computer game. I haven't branched out much:
I'm sticking to science fiction for the most part. I also re-read a few books,
which ended up being especially enjoyable because I picked up so much more the
second time through.

Following the tradition of [2023][fav_2023] and [2024][fav_2024], here are my
favorite books from 2025:

## <cite class="book-title">Disco Elysium</cite>

"{{ disco }} isn't a book, Alex!" Ok, sure, but it **is** one of the literary
masterpieces of the 21st century. It does a miraculous job of immersing the
player in its world, exploring the grip the past has on the present, and
creating some of the deepest and most fully developed characters in any
medium. It's my favorite game of all time, and one of my favorite literary
works, period.

## The <span class="book-series">Hyperion Cantos</span> by <span class="author-name">Dan Simmons</span>

{% capture hyp %}{% book_link "Hyperion" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture fall %}{% book_link "The Fall of Hyperion" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture cantos %}{% series_link "Hyperion Cantos" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture simmons %}{% author_link "Dan Simmons" link_text="Simmons" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture keatss %}{% author_link "John Keats" possessive %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture hyperion3 %}{% book_link "Endymion" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture hyperion4 %}{% book_link "The Rise of Endymion" %}{% endcapture %}

I didn't love the {{ cantos }} the first time I read them. I found {{ fall }},
the easier and more straightforward of the two, to be great, but I didn't
really get {{ hyp }}. This year I re-read them for my book club and focused on
finding and understanding the influences from {{ keatss }} works. That
completely transformed the experience. I **LOVED** {{ hyp }}, and now view it
as a new masterpiece of the genre.

This year I'll be tackling {{ hyperion3 }} and {{ hyperion4 }}, which I've
heard don't live up to the greatness of the first two, but I'm still hopeful.

<div class="card-grid">

  {% book_card_lookup title="The Fall of Hyperion" date="2025-12-30" %}

## <cite class="book-title">The Hydrogen Sonata</cite> by <span class="author-name">Iain M. Banks</span>

{% capture banks_full %}{% author_link "Iain M. Banks" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture banks %}{% author_link "Iain M. Banks" link_text="Banks" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture bankss %}{% author_link "Iain M. Banks" link_text="Banks" possessive %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture sonata %}{% book_link "The Hydrogen Sonata" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture culture %}{% series_link "Culture" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture phlebas %}{% book_link "Consider Phlebas" %}{% endcapture %}

{{ bankss }} {{ culture }} series was one of my [favorite reads in
2024][fav_2024]. I deliberately delayed finishing it, spacing out the final
few books because I knew that once I was done, it would be over for good. {{
sonata }} was a fitting end to the series. It restates many of the themes {{
banks }} first explored in {{ phlebas }}, but with a more hopeful bent.

It also feels like a fitting final book for {{ banks_full }} himself, with its
message that life only has the meaning you give it.

## The <span class="book-series">Teixcalaan</span> series by <span class="author-name">Arkady Martine</span>

{% capture memory %}{% book_link "A Memory Called Empire" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture peace %}{% book_link "A Desolation Called Peace" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture teixcalaan %}{% series_link "Teixcalaan" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture martine %}{% author_link "Arkady Martine" link_text="Martine" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture martines %}{% author_link "Arkady Martine" link_text="Martine" possessive %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture wolfes %}{% author_link "Gene Wolfe" possessive %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture botns %}{% series_link "The Book of the New Sun" %}{% endcapture %}

Another pair of books picked by my book club. I really enjoyed {{ martines }}
subtle worldbuilding and the deep integration of themes and motifs across {{
memory }} and {{ peace }}. The writing itself is beautiful, and often reminded
me of {{ wolfes }} {{ botns }}, with its mix of archaic prose and intentional
vagueness.

## <cite class="book-title">Roadside Picnic</cite> by <span class="author-name">Arkady</span> and <span class="author-name">Boris Strugatsky</span>

{% capture picnic %}{% book_link "Roadside Picnic" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture strugatskys %}{% author_link "Arkady Strugatsky" link_text="Arkady" %} and {% author_link "Boris Strugatsky" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture strugatskyss %}{% author_link "Arkady Strugatsky" link_text="Arkady" %} and {% author_link "Boris Strugatsky" possessive %}{% endcapture %}

I picked up {{ strugatskyss }} best-known novel, {{ picnic }}, because I
wanted to broaden what I was reading. I ended up loving it. The characters
feel incredibly real, the dialogue has a simple but earnest quality, and the
atmosphere is completely different from western sci-fi.

It wasn't the only book of theirs that I read, but it was easily my favorite.

## <span class="book-series">The Murderbot Diaries</span> by <span class="author-name">Martha Wells</span>

{% capture art_cond %}{% book_link "Artificial Condition" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture rogue %}{% book_link "Rogue Protocol" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture exit %}{% book_link "Exit Strategy" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture net_eff %}{% book_link "Network Effect" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture murderbot %}{% series_link "The Murderbot Diaries" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture wells %}{% author_link "Martha Wells" link_text="Wells" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture wellss %}{% author_link "Martha Wells" link_text="Wells" possessive %}{% endcapture %}

Everyone loves {{ murderbot }}, and I'm no exception. {{ wells }} hits the
perfect mix of pulpy action, fast pacing, and memorable characters, while
still digging into deep philosophical questions about what it means to be a
person. I've got a few more to go this year, and I'm really looking forward to
them. I fully expect to see them in my 2026 list.

<div class="card-grid">

  {% book_card_lookup title="Exit Strategy" date="2025-05-23" %}
  {% book_card_lookup title="Network Effect" date="2025-07-17" %}

## <cite class="book-title">There Is No Antimemetics Division</cite> by <span class="author-name">qntm</span>

{% capture antimeme %}{% book_link "There Is No Antimemetics Division" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture original %}{% book_link "There Is No Antimemetics Division (Original Edition)" link_text="original edition" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture qntm %}{% author_link "qntm" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture qntms %}{% author_link "qntm" possessive %}{% endcapture %}

I read {{ qntms }} {{ original }} edition in 2023 and thought it was packed
full of amazing ideas, but ultimately let down by a poorly written second act.
His rewrite this year fixed every single problem. The result is a tight,
cohesive book that brings its wild concepts to life. Highly recommend.

## <cite class="book-title">A Mote in Shadow</cite> by <span class="author-name">A. N. Alex</span>

{% capture mote %}{% book_link "A Mote in Shadow" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture alex %}{% author_link "A. N. Alex" link_text="Alex" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture alexs %}{% author_link "A. N. Alex" link_text="Alex" possessive %}{% endcapture %}

I found this book when my corner of BlueSky started talking about it, and I'm
glad I paid attention. {{ alexs }} debut novel is a fantastic mix of hard
sci-fi and techno-thriller, set in a fractured human civilization in the
not-too-distant future. He's working on the sequel now, and I'm very much
looking forward to it.

## <cite class="book-title">The Triumphant</cite> by <span class="author-name">Linda Evans</span>, <span class="author-name">Robert R. Hollingsworth</span>, and <span class="author-name">David Weber</span>

{% capture triumphant %}{% book_link "The Triumphant" %}{% endcapture %}

{% capture hollingsworths %}{% author_link "Robert R. Hollingsworth" possessive %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture hollingsworth_lastname %}{% author_link "Robert R. Hollingsworth" link_text="Hollingsworth" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture hollingsworths_lastname %}{% author_link "Robert R. Hollingsworth" link_text="Hollingsworth" possessive %}{% endcapture %}

{% capture weber %}{% author_link "David Weber" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture webers %}{% author_link "David Weber" possessive %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture weber_lastname %}{% author_link "David Weber" link_text="Weber" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture webers_lastname %}{% author_link "David Weber" link_text="Weber" possessive %}{% endcapture %}

{% capture combined_authors %}{{ evans }}, {{ hollingsworth }}, and {{ weber }}{% endcapture %}

I started reading the {{ bolo }} books when I was a teen and absolutely loved
them. Giant tanks blowing stuff up, but, like {{ murderbot }}, they also
broach deeper questions about the meaning of being alive, and if honor and
duty translate to machines. I recently started re-reading the series for
nostalgia. While most of the books are serviceable but not great, {{
triumphant }} is the clear exception.
