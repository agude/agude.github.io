The [daylight saving time][dst] (DST) change is awful---we get less sleep and
it [might not even save energy][energy] as was intended! Worse, studies by
[Varughese & Allen][varughese] and [Smith][smith] have shown that the time
change increases the number of automobile accidents! Let's look for a similar
trend in the [SWITRS data][s2s_post] that I've collected.

## Accident Ratio

The analysis is relatively simple. I start with the number of accidents that
happen on the days following the start of DST in California. I divide the
amount of accidents on each day by the number of accidents on the same day of
the week but two weeks later.[^1] Taking the ratio cancels out most of the
effects that are unrelated to the time change---like the fact that [accident
rates vary by 30% depending on the year][apw]. Two weeks after is a good
choice for normalization because:

[apw]: {% post_url 2016-12-02-switrs_crashes_by_date %}#accidents-per-week

- The weeks after the time change have similar daylight hours to the week of
the time change.
- The accident rate is still slightly elevated a week later, so normalizing by
the very next week hides some of the increase that is due to the start of
DST.[^2]

The [violin plots][violin] below show the distribution of these ratios from
the years 2001 to 2016. A value greater than 1 means that there are more
accidents during the week when DST starts than two weeks after.

after the start of daylight saving time, divided by the week two weeks
after.][ratio_plot]][ratio_plot]

[ratio_plot]: {{ file_dir }}/accidents_two_weeks_after_dst_change_in_california.svg

Except for Sunday, every day of the week following the time change has on
average a higher rate of accidents! I am surprised that the accident rate
stays high the entire week. This indicates that it takes even longer than a
week for people to catch up on sleep and for the accident rate to go back to
normal.

## _t_-Test

So the "_chi-by-eye_" plot is suggestive, but I can quantify whether the
results are significant using a [two-tailed paired _t_-test][paired_t-test].
This is the method Varughese & Allen use. Doing so gives the following
results.

[paired_t-test]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Paired_samples

| Day          | _t_-value |   _p_-value |
|:-------------|----------:|------------:|
| **Monday**   |       2.7 |   **0.017** |
| **Tuesday**  |       2.5 |   **0.023** |
| Wednesday    |       1.6 |     0.122   |
| Thursday     |       1.4 |     0.191   |
| Friday       |       0.9 |     0.361   |
| **Saturday** |       2.6 |   **0.019** |
| Sunday (DST) |      -1.6 |     0.121   |

The increase in accidents on Monday is significant, as is Tuesday and
Saturday. Sunday is the only day that trends lower (matching the plot), but
not significantly.

So daylight savings time causes more accidents, but those of us in California
might be in luck! State Assembly member [Kansen Chu][chu] has introduced a
bill to [finally do away with DST][ab-385]! Hopefully it will pass and let us
all get that hour of sleep we deserve.

**Update**: I have rewritten part of this article to make my methodology
clearer and add a _t_-test. The changes can be found in git; the [first
set][changes_1] and the [second set][changes_2].

[changes_1]: https://github.com/agude/agude.github.io/commit/1092c8ce001a946eb47ae07cc0c65324a1417a82

[^1]: It is also possible to use the week before or the week directly after the DST change to normalize. For the curious, I have also made [a plot using the week before for normalization][before_plot] and [the week after][after_plot]. They both show the same trend.
[^2]: I assume that people are back to normal after three weeks, and so I use that week as a control. I then compare that ratios of the control week with [one week after the DST change][1_vs_3] and [two weeks after the DST change][2_vs_3] to see which is more normal. One week after has Monday and Thursday high, indicating people are still having more accidents than we expect. Two weeks after the ratios are near one, and so I conclude people are back to normal by then.
