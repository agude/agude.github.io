One of the first steps when exploring data is to look at its distribution. For
single distributions, or for comparing a small number, [histograms][hist] are
great. However, as the number of distributions to compare grows, histograms
become less and less useful for visualizing data. Fortunately, there are some
good alternatives.

In this post, I'll look at a few different plot types I explored when
comparing the [distributions of accidents by day of the week][dotw]. More
information about the data can be found in the original post: [_SWITRS: On
What Days Do People Crash?_][post]

## Box Plots

[**Box Plots**][box], or box-and-whisker plots, are one of the simpler ways of
plotting a series of distributions. The edges of the box show the 1st and 3rd quartile
while the line within the box shows the median (2nd quartile). The whiskers
show the extent of the data, but their usage is not standardized. Sometimes
they show the full extent of the data, sometimes some percentage of the
inner-quartile range, and sometimes one standard deviation from the mean. If
they do not show the full extent, the points not included in the whiskers are
plotted individually.

Box plots quickly convey some essential statistics about the distributions
and make no assumptions about the underlying data, which is both a strength
and a weakness. Their simplicity can hide important information, and their
non-standard whiskers can cause confusion if what they represent is not
clearly stated.

These box plots show the distributions of the [number of accidents per day in
California by day of the week][dotw] from 2001--2015. From the box plots it is
easy to see that there are more accidents on Fridays and that the weekends have
fewer accidents than the weekdays. Most of the outliers are on the high side,
but we can't tell anything about the actual shape of the distributions.

## Strip Plots

[**Strip Plots**][strip], also called dot plots or univariate dot plots, try
to give us a little---well a lot---more information than box plots. They plot
_every_ point in the dataset, which can give you a good view of what is
happening. They often have a bit of random jitter added to each point along
the categorical axis so that the points do not overlap as much.

Strip plots make it is easy to see all the outliers. The density of points
also gives an approximation of the underlying distribution, although this can
be hard to judge by eye because the distance in the categorical axis, while
meaningless, obscures the true distance between points. Overlapping points
also make it tough to estimate the true distribution, especially as the number
of points increases.

[strip_plot_png]: {{ file_dir }}/accidents_by_day_of_the_week_strip.png

With the strip plot it is still possible to tell which days have more
accidents, but without the quartiles to guide the eye it is not as easy. We
can now start to see that the distributions are bimodal, although it is
difficult to see details with all the points. Strip plots are enticing because
they show literally all of the data, but plots which summarize the data are
often more useful for large datasets.

## Swarm Plots

[**Swarm Plots**][swarm], also called beeswarm plots, are similar to strip
plots in that they plot all of the data points. Unlike strip plots, swarm
plots attempt to avoid obscuring points by calculating non-overlapping
positions instead of adding random jitter. This sort of gives them appearance
of a swarm of bees, or perhaps a honeycomb.

[swarm]: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/~eklund/beeswarm/

Swarm plots share many of the same advantages of strip plots, but without as
much clutter to hide their salient features. Unfortunately, spreading out the
points in a non-overlapping fashion limits the number of points that can be
plotted---there is only so much space on the page! Additionally, the algorithm
that calculates the positions is computationally expensive and so scales poorly
as the number of points increases.[^1]

This slow generation time is especially harmful during exploratory analyses.
It is easy to keep engaged with the problem when a plot takes a second
or two to pop up, but when they take more than a minute my productivity
plummets as my iteration time explodes and I have to constantly context
switch.

[swarm_plot_png]: {{ file_dir }}/accidents_by_day_of_the_week_swarm.png

I generated this plot using a sampled subset of the data because the swarms
piled up when trying to show the full dataset. Even so, you can see some of the
points have piled up against the edges of each column. The swarm plot makes
the relative accident rates easier to see than on the strip plot. The bimodal
nature of the distributions is much clearer and their shape can almost be made
out. However, the thickness of the plotted points causes the formation of the
strands extending out from each swarm which make judging the true shape of the
distributions difficult.

## Violin Plots

[**Violin plots**][violin] plots try to give an indication of the distribution
of data without cluttering the plot by drawing all of the points. They do
this by using [kernel density estimation (KDE)][kde] to model the
distribution. There is a lot of information to process in a violin plot so
they can be a bit tough to read. The shape of the violin body indicates the
number of observations: if the violin is thick at some value it means there
are a lot of data points there, if it is thin then there are few. The inside
of the violin is often marked to indicate additional information. The violins
below have the quartiles draw inside them as dashed lines, but miniature box
plots are another common inner marking.

[violin]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot
[kde]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation

The main disadvantage of violin plots is that the KDE bandwidth must be
selected. Too low and the features of the data are washed out. Too high and
the KDE overfits the data. This limits their usefulness when there are only a
few data points. The lack of standardization when it comes to the inner
markings also makes them hard to interpret if they aren't explicitly
explained.

from 2001–2015 by day of the week.][violin_plot]][violin_plot]

[violin_plot]: {{ file_dir }}/accidents_by_day_of_the_week_violin.svg

The violin plots make the bimodal nature of the distributions crystal clear.
Likewise it is easy to see that there is an increase on Friday and a decrease
on Sunday. However, we have lost sight of our outliers. We can see that the
Friday violin extends to almost 3000 accidents, but exactly how many data
points go into that thin tail is unclear.

## Conclusion

I like violin plots [**a**][dotw] [**whole**][moto_dotw] [**lot**][dst]! While
swarm and strip plots show lots of detail and box plots provide good overviews
with the summary statistics, I find violin plots to be a good middle ground.
The KDE provides more detail than a pure box plot, includes the same useful
summary statistics, and avoids cluttering the plot with every data point.
