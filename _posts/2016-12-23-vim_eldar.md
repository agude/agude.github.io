  Check out Eldar, my custom Vim color scheme based on elflord. It is a
  bright, high-contrast theme that looks great in the terminal or GUI!

  The Eldar color scheme logo. It is the word Eldar in grey on a black
  background. The word is underlined with a line broken into six segments. The
  segments are red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple, and match the
  colors used in the color scheme.

[![{{ page.image_alt }}]({{ page.image }})][eldar]

I use [Vim][vim] (actually [Neovim][neovim]) as my primary text editor. I
write Python in it, against all advice I write C++ in it, and I even write
these posts in it. Vim is highly customizable, and because its configuration
files are just plaintext, [my environment][dotfiles] can be set up with a
simple `git pull`. This has made it worth spending time customizing Vim to be
exactly the editor I want; one of those customizations is my color scheme:
[**Eldar**][eldar].

## Eldar

Eldar is based on [elflord][elcs], one of the default Vim color schemes. I
discovered it when I first started using Vim, and I grew to love its 16 bright
colors. But elflord isn't actually a 16 color scheme, so when I finally fixed
my terminal to use all 256 colors, elflord no longer looked the way I wanted.
I decided to create my own color scheme, one designed to use only 16 colors
from the start. The fact that designing the scheme served double duty as
[structured procrastination][sp] to avoid [my thesis][thesis] (also written in
Vim) was merely a bonus!

### Colors

Eldar looks great in both the GUI and terminal because it uses fewer than 16
colors. Eldar uses the [Tango color palette][tango] in the GUI by default, but
these colors can be overridden by setting `g:eldar_*` variables. Eldar
uses both colors and font weight to differentiate various elements. It is not
a subtle scheme; it uses white on black text and there is high contrast
between nine colors. An example of the color scheme for Python with spell
checking turned on and the word '_Fibonacci_' highlighted:

### Comparison

Eldar defines many more `highlight` groups than elflord, allowing additional
elements to be themed. It colors function declarations and control statements.
Eldar uses different colors for strings and for numbers. It also supports
italic and bold text (for example, in [Markdown][markdown] and
[LaTeX][latex]). Eldar uses underlining for spelling errors just like your
browser or document editor.

A comparison of Eldar to 16 color elflord is shown below. Spell checking is
turned on and the word '_Handle_' has been highlighted.

### Installation

You can install Eldar by downloading the [`eldar.vim` file][file] and placing
it in `~/.vim/colors/`, or by using whatever plugin manager you prefer. For
example, with [vim-plug][plug]:

[file]: https://github.com/agude/vim-eldar/blob/master/colors/eldar.vim
[plug]: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

```vim
Plug 'agude/vim-eldar'
```

You can activate the color scheme with:

```vim
:colorscheme eldar
```

Or put it in your `.vimrc` so it activates every time you open Vim:

```vim
"------------------------
" Syntax: highlighting
"------------------------
if has('syntax')
    syntax enable             " Turn on syntax highlighting
    silent! colorscheme eldar " Custom color scheme
endif
```

Give Eldar a try! If something doesn't work, please report it on [Eldar's
Github page][eldar]. Thanks!
