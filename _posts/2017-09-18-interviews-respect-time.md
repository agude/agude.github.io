A lot has been written about how to perform technical interviews. What
questions to ask, what questions not to ask, why the questions we used to ask
are bad. I have nothing of value to add to that debate.[^1]

What I do have to add is one guiding principle for the interviewing company:
**Do not waste anyone's time!**

Do not waste the time of the candidate by making them jump through endless
hoops. Do not waste the time of your own people (the ones performing the
interview) by losing candidates due to poor communication. To this end, I have
two simple pieces of advice that very few of the companies I have interviewed
with have followed.

## Structure: Just Enough

A few companies I have interviewed with have had labyrinthine processes such
as:

- multiple phone screens
- multiple days of on-site interview loops
- phone screens as well as take-home projects

Instead of utilizing such protracted methods, ask what you hope to learn with
a second interview (or phone screen, or data challenge) that you failed to
learn the first time, and then figure out how to learn that key piece of
information in just one round.

I think the following steps are enough:

- Resume screen (performed without the candidate)
- Casual chat with the candidate about the position
- Technical screen
- On-site interview loop

## Communicate: Often

The vast majority of companies follow poor communication practices during the
hiring process. Often, there are long periods of silence followed by
unpredictable bursts of noise. Worse, some companies simply stop communicating
altogether! The companies that offered the best experience had recruiters who
stayed in constant contact, and who set appointments and kept them. The
absolute best even scheduled the post on-site interview loop feedback (and
hiring decision) phone call at the same time they gave me the schedule for the
on-site itself. I very much appreciated knowing that I would know the outcome
at a set time in the future.

Improving communication during the hiring process is simple. Communicate
before each step in the hiring process and let the candidate know what to
expect. Then communicate after each step and let the candidate know whether or
not they are continuing in the hiring process. Ideally, schedule these
interactions ahead of time so there is no doubt as to when they will happen.
This gives the candidate a fixed date on which they will have an answer, and
gives a deadline to the hiring team to make a decision.

## That's It

It is tough to hire, but it is not tough to be better at structuring
interviews. Respect the time of all parties involved and you will be well on
your way to a better experience for the candidates and the interviewers.
