Social media died for me in 2023. Twitter and Reddit both shutdown their third
party API making accessing them a pain, and the quality of Twitter decreased
significantly with its sale to Elon Musk. I realized how much time I had
wasted on social media and decided to spend it more wisely by reading books. I
bought a Kindle in October and finished 20 books between then and the end of
the year.

I [review all the books I read][book_reviews], here is a selection of my
favorites that I read in 2023:

## <span class="book-title">Blindsight</span> by <span clas="author-name">Peter Watts</span>

<span class="book-title">Blindsight</span> does a great job of exploring the
nature of consciousness and intelligence. Watts keeps the tension high and the
plot moving quickly in this thought-provoking sci-fi novel. My favorite book
of the year!

## The Chronicle of the Fallers by <span clas="author-name">Peter F. Hamilton</span>

Hamilton is known for his space opera, but <span class="book">The Abyss Beyond
Dreams</span> is more urban fantasy set during the Russian Revolution and <span
class="book">Night Without Stars</span> is a thriller set during the Cold War.
a Cold War thriller. Both feature Commonwealth citizens with special knowledge
as _"Outside Context Problems"_, pulling the stories into science fiction
territory.

## <span class="book-title">The Fall of Hyperion</span> by <span class="author-name">Dan Simmons</span>

I enjoyed the sequel to {% include book_link.html title="Hyperion" %} the most
of the two books because it tied the personal story of the pilgrims to a much
broader galactic conflict. Interestingly, you can see a lot of ideas in the
Hyperion Cantos that Hamilton later adopted in his Commonwealth Saga including
wormholes, a breakaway-but-helpful AI, and different factions of
scheming AI who either want to eradicate the humans or uplift them.

## The Commonwealth Series by <span clas="author-name">Peter F. Hamilton</span>

Epic space opera with a massive cast of characters and incredible pacing.

</div>

## <span class="book-title">Serpent Valley</span> by <span class="author-name">Scott Warren</span>

1980s mech sci-fi re-imagined for the 21st century. Warren's self-published
series takes a few books to really find its feet, but once it does, it's a
quick, fun, nostalgic read. The third book, <span class="book-title">Serpent
Valley</span>, exemplifies what Warren is going for.
