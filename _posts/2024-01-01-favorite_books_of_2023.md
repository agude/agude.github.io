Social media died for me in 2023. Twitter and Reddit both shutdown their third
party API making accessing them a pain, and the quality of Twitter decreased
significantly with its sale to Elon Musk. I realized how much time I had
wasted on social media and decide to spend it more wisely by reading books. I
bought a Kindle in October and finished 20 book between then and the end of
the year.

I [review all the books I read][book_reviews], here is a selection of my
favorites.

## <span class="book-title">Blindsight</span> by <span clas="author-name">Peter Watts</span>

<span class="book-title">Blindsight</span> does a great job of making you
think about what it means to... think. While also keeping the tension high and
the story moving quickly. My favorite book of the year!

## The Chronicle of the Fallers by <span clas="author-name">Peter F. Hamilton</span>

Hamilton mostly writes "space opera" but <span class="book">The Abyss Beyond
Dreams</span> is urban fantasy set during the Russian Revolution and <span
class="book">Night Without Stars</span> is a thriller set during the Cold War.
Both have an _"Outside Context Problem"_---Commonwealth citizens with special
knowledge and technology---that pull them into the realm of sci fi.

## <span class="book-title">The Fall of Hyperion</span> by <span class="author-name">Dan Simmons</span>

I enjoyed the sequel to {% include book_link.html title="Hyperion" %} the most
of the two books because it tied the personal story of the pilgrims to a much
broader galaxy. Interestingly, you can see a lot of ideas in the Hyperion
Cantos that Hamilton would adopt in his Commonwealth Saga including wormholes,
a breakaway faction of AIs, and different factions of scheming AI who either
want to eradicate the humans or uplift them.

## The Commonwealth Series by <span clas="author-name">Peter F. Hamilton</span>

Pure space opera with a massive cast of characters and incredible pacing.

## <span class="book-title">Serpent Valley</span> by <span class="author-name">Scott Warren</span>

1980s mech sci fi re-imagined for the 21st century. Warren's self-published
series takes a few books to really find its feet, but once it does it's a
quick, fun, nostalgic read. The third book, <span class="book-title">Serpent
Valley</span>, gets everything right.
