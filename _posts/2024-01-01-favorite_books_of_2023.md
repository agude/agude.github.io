Social media died for me in 2023. Twitter and Reddit both shutdown their third
party API making accessing them a pain, and the quality of Twitter decreased
significantly with its sale to Elon Musk. I realized how much time I had
wasted on social media and decided to spend it more wisely by reading books. I
bought a Kindle in October and finished 20 books between then and the end of
the year.

I [review all the books I read][book_reviews], here is a selection of my
favorites that I read in 2023:

## <cite class="book-title">Blindsight</cite> by <span class="author-name">Peter Watts</span>

<cite class="book-title">Blindsight</cite> does a great job of exploring the
nature of consciousness and intelligence. Watts keeps the tension high and the
plot moving quickly in this thought-provoking sci-fi novel. My favorite book
of the year!

## <span class="book-series">The Chronicle of the Fallers</span> by <span class="author-name">Peter F. Hamilton</span>

Hamilton is known for his space opera, but <cite class="book-title">The Abyss
Beyond Dreams</cite> is more urban fantasy set during the Russian Revolution
(in space) and <cite class="book-title">Night Without Stars</cite> is a
thriller set during the Cold War (again, in space). Both feature Commonwealth
citizens with special knowledge as _"Outside Context Problems"_, pulling the
stories into science fiction territory.

  {% book_card_lookup title="Night Without Stars" date="2023-12-15" %}
</div>

## <cite class="book-title">The Fall of Hyperion</cite> by <span class="author-name">Dan Simmons</span>

I enjoyed the sequel to {% book_link "Hyperion" %} the most
of the two books because it tied the personal story of the pilgrims to a much
broader galactic conflict. Interestingly, you can see a lot of ideas in the
Hyperion Cantos that Hamilton later adopted in his Commonwealth Saga including
wormholes, a breakaway-but-helpful AI, and different factions of
scheming AI who either want to eradicate the humans or uplift them.

## <span class="book-series">The Commonwealth Saga</span> by <span class="author-name">Peter F. Hamilton</span>

Epic space opera with a massive cast of characters and incredible pacing.

<div class="card-grid">
  {% book_card_lookup title="Pandora's Star" date="2023-08-23" %}
  {% book_card_lookup title="Judas Unchained" date="2023-09-03" %}
</div>

## <cite class="book-title">Serpent Valley</cite> by <span class="author-name">Scott Warren</span>

1980s mech sci-fi re-imagined for the 21st century. Warren's self-published
series takes a few books to really find its feet, but once it does, it's a
quick, fun, nostalgic read. The third book, <cite class="book-title">Serpent
Valley</cite>, exemplifies the series.
