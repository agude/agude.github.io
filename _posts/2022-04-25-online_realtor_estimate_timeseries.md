I [wrote about the pre- and post-sale estimates][previous_post] of a house's
price from four online brokers a little while ago. One limitation of that
experiment was that I only collected the data at a few points in time for the
house: one value before the listing, one value after the listing, and a final
value after the sale.

But what if the estimates change day-to-day? [Christopher Moody][chris] posted

I decided to look.

You can find the Jupyter notebook used to perform this analysis
[here][notebook] ([rendered on Github][rendered]). The data can be found
[here][data].

## Data Collection

I recorded the estimated sales price everyday from Zillow and Redfin. I
excluded Realtor.com and Xome because they do not update their estimate
frequently (they seem to only update when the status of the house changes from
pre-listing to listing to pending to sold). I occasionally missed a day of
data because I was collecting it manually.

Unfortunately the idea to collect the time series came after the house was
already pending, so I missed some of the most interesting changes. I have set
up a Python script to scrape listings for a few other houses and should have a
better time series for another article.

## Plot

Here a plot comparing the estimates for the sales price from Zillow and Redfin
in time:

according to Zillow, and the other is the estimate for the same house from
Redfin.][my_plot]][my_plot]

The daily price estimates from Redfin are shown using red circles, the
estimates for Zillow are shown using blue triangles.

### Comments

There is _a lot_ of movement in the estimates. Redfin and Zillow start off far
apart. Redfin reverts strongly to the list price once the house if official on
the market (I missed Zillow's price on the day of listing). As the house goes
pending, both estimates increase drastically.

This suggests that some impression metric is used in both models, because
there is not much other information available that could cause such a large
increase. It will be interesting to see what a better time series will reveal.

Both estimates vary day-to-day even after the house is pending. You would
think all the information you need to determine the sale price would be
present once the offer is made, but there are facts you can observe after the
listing is pending---like how long the closing period is---that must have
predictive power. Redfin's estimate remains pretty tight while Zillow's
changes wildly, sometimes by 20% between days! The high variance really
reduces my confidence in Zillow's model.

Finally, both estimates completely miss the actual sales price. The estimates
eventually jump to near the sales price, but it is not immediate; they take
about a week to adjust. Possibly a model update is triggered immediately for
newly listed properties---notice how the Redfin price adjusts the same day it
was listed---but not for sales? This makes some sense. A listing is an event
these business care about because they can profit off it, but a sale does not
provide that opportunity.
