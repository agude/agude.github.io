After graduating from the University of Minnesota, I moved back to California
to attend [Insight Data Science][insight]. Insight is a seven week program
that takes newly minted PhDs in quantitative fields and grooms them for
careers in data science. The first four weeks of the program focus on building
a data product using publicly available data. The project I built,
**Whereto.photo**, tried to answer the question: _Where is the best place in
this city to take a picture?_

In this post I'm going to walk through how I built my project from
brainstorming and data processing to hosting.

## Project Ideas

I had a few ideas about the sort of project I wanted to build when I arrived
at Insight. The ideas were mostly based on my hobbies: cycling, running, and
photography. But I knew that one of the hardest things about making a project
was finding public data to use, so before settling on any idea I checked to
see what data was available. There was not much data on running or
cycling--Strava keeps their site locked down pretty tight--but there were a
lot of photos available from Instagram and Flickr, so I decided to do a photo
project.

When I arrive in a new city I generally already have an idea of what landmarks
I want to shoot, maybe a sunset or a bridge or a [wall caked in gum][gumwall],
but I don't know the best place to go to shoot them. So the question I decided
to answer was: _Where can I go around here to take the best picture of X?_

[gumwall]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gum_Wall

Answering this question would require me to determine three things about the
photos that made up my data:

1. Location
2. Subject
3. Quality

## Dataset

I initially explored using data from Instagram, but found that their API made
it difficult to request photos from a single area, which made answering the
location part of my question difficult. I settled on using Flickr because
its API allowed me to ask for all photos within some radius of a fixed point
which made it very easy to download just the photos taken in the cities I was
interested in.

I ended up downloading every photo that was taken between June 1st, 2014 and
May 31st, 2015 within 20km of the centers of San Francisco (Lat 37.74, Lon
-122.42), Seattle (47.61, -122.34), and New York (40.70, -73.98). I included
only public photos that were marked by Flickr as being "safe for work"
(although that tag is only as good as the reviewers on the site). San
Francisco had 255,232 photos, Seattle had 118,464, and New York had 474,649.

Here is every photo in my dataset for San Francisco:

## Photo Subject and Quality

Once I had the data downloaded, the next step was to determine what was in
each photo, and how good the photo was. Unfortunately, computer vision is hard
and not something that I could tackle on the time scale of several weeks. That
left me with only user applied tags as the means of determining the content of
the images.

There are two types of tags applied to Flickr images. The first type are user
applied tags, and the second type are machine applied tags. Machine applied
tags generally just duplicate the [EXIF data][exif] and so I removed them.
User tags are (as their name suggests) applied by the user and may contain any
information they deem appropriate. These tags often contain subjects ("golden
gate"), locations ("san francisco"), equipment notes ("canon ef 50mm f/1.8"),
and emotions ("sad"). All tags were converted to lowercase to remove
duplicates that differed only by capitalization. Unfortunately
[flickrapi][api], which I used to make my requests, takes multi-word tags and
removes the spaces leaving a single monster word. This meant that when users
accessed my project I also had to strip the spaces from their queries in order
to match tags.

[exif]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif
[api]: https://stuvel.eu/flickrapi-doc/

To determine the quality of a photo I had two pieces of metadata I could use:
views and favorites. I decided to use views because favorites were rare; any
click was counted as a view but only logged in users could mark a photo as a
favorite. I would have liked to do comparison testing of views to favorites,
but views worked well enough and I felt my time was better spent elsewhere. To
select the very best photos for each tag, I took the top 10% of photos in
terms of views (or the first 20, whichever was larger) and used that as my
dataset.

## The Best Spot

Having selected the best photos for each tag, I needed to determine where the
best spot to take a photos of the tagged subject.

My first attempt was to cluster the photos in space, weighted by their
quality, so that the cluster centers would indicate areas of high quality
photos. I tried [_k_-means clustering][kmeans] and [DBSCAN][dbscan] but found
them too inflexible; some tags had a single cluster of photos while others had
many, and the density and spacing between clusters varied too much from tag to
tag for any single set of parameters to work.

[kmeans]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering
[dbscan]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN

My second attempt used [kernel density estimation (KDE)][kde] to estimate the
probability density of good photos in the city as a function of location. The
maximum in this distribution was then the "best spot" to take a photo of the
tagged thing. This algorithm worked well, except it favored areas with lots of
photos, not necessarily areas with the best photos. For example, in San
Francisco the maximum of the "flowers" KDE was in the financial distract, not
because the best flower photos were taken there, but because every tourist
took dozens of mediocre photos there tagged flowers.

[kde]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation

My solution to this was to calculate a second, global KDE for each city using
every photo. I then divided the KDE for a specific tag by the global KDE which
gave me a ratio: `Number of Good Photos / All Photos`. The maximum of this
normalized function would be in a location where many good photos with the
specific tag were taken, but few photos in general were taken; essentially the
algorithm now preferred areas with a surprisingly large amount of quality
photos instead of areas with just a large number of photos.

The maximum of this normalized KDE was computed by using the
[Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm][bfgs] from SciPy. The fitter
often wandered off the edge of the map and into the water, and so a penalty
was applied to all points in the water (using the `basemap.isWater()` method).
The starting locations of the minimizer were hand selected to cover the major
land masses in each city.

[bfgs]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm

An example fit for the tag `goldengate` is shown below. The blue point is the
estimated best location, the green triangles are the hand selected start
points, the red heat map is the normalized KDE, and black dots are the photos
used in the calculation.

## The Website

The results of the analysis was made available on **Whereto.photo**. The
website was served with [Flask][flask], and the maxima for
each tag and the associated photos were stored in a MySQL database. The user
input was lowercased and concatenated into a single string and only exact
matches to tags were used.

[flask]: http://flask.pocoo.org/

Here is what the website would show if the user searched for "Golden Gate":

[![The result page of the query "Golden Gate"][result_page]][result_page]

[result_page]: {{ file_dir }}/Goldengate.png

The blue circles are photos, and the blue marker is the predicted best
location. You can see the best location matches the maximum found on the
heat map example above. The user can click on the various photos and a preview
of them would load from Flickr. This allowed the user to verify that the
photos in the predicted best location were in fact great photos. Here is an
example of the user clicking on a photo near the best location for the "Golden
Gate" query:

Sometimes though, the algorithm failed, as in this case for the search term
"Cars":

[![A failed search for "Cars"][failed_search]][failed_search]

[failed_search]: {{ file_dir }}/Cars_failure.png

In this case the normalization by the global KDE made Treasure Island the
predicted best location because the only photos taken there were for a car
show, giving a very high ratio of good photos. While there were good car
photos taken there, the event was a one time deal and so the recommendation is
not generally useful.

Finally, I'll leave you with a video of the site to give you a feel for how it
worked:
