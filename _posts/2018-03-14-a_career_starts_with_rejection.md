title: "The Typical Successful Career Starts with Rejection"
description: >
  When I applied for graduate school I was rejected, not by a few good grad
  schools, but by all of them! But thanks to a little kindness, I was able to
  continue onward.

[Moritz Hardt][mrtz] posted a [tweet][mrtz_tweet] the other day saying "It's
that time of the year to keep in mind that the typical start of a successful
academic career is getting rejected from a bunch of good grad schools." Lots
of people replied about how their own failures did not stop them. This post is
my own response.

My story is a little different than Moritz's. [I do not have an academic
career][phd], I was rejected, not by a few good grad schools, but by all of
them, and yet, I am happy with where I ended up.

## To Grad School

I wanted to be a Physicist since I was fourteen, so I knew the path before me:
BA, PhD, professor. As I finished up my BA at [Berkeley][ucb], I started
preparing for the GRE. But test anxiety caused me to study poorly, and
ultimately my test results were terrible. None of the graduate schools I
applied to in 2008 accepted me.

I tried again in 2009. Not the GRE, since thinking about it brought even more
anxiety than the first time, but simply applying once again to various
graduate schools. Thankfully, the [University of Minnesota][umn] (and more
specifically, the too kind [Yuichi Kubota][yk]) looked past my test scores and
gave me a spot. I wasn't the only person he gave a chance to, but I'm thankful
that I was one of them.

## And Onward

I graduated from grad school in 2015 and went to [Insight Data
Science][insight]. From there I got a job doing machine learning at
[Lab41][lab41], where I published [a paper][paper] ([arXiv][arxiv]) and spent
two great years learning from my brilliant coworkers. Now, I lead a data
science team at [Intuit][intuit]. Failing to get into graduate school in 2008
was crushing at the time, but it taught me that everyone falls, and sometimes
they just need a bit of a hand to get back up and on their way.
