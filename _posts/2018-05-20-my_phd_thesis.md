Three years ago today, I defended [my thesis][thesis] and graduated from the
University of Minnesota with a [PhD][phd] in high energy particle physics. As
part of that endeavor, I spent years traveling to and from [CERN][cern] where
I studied the decay of [Z bosons][z] into [electrons][e]. I wrote an esoteric
thesis on a very specific part of this decay which I have, because no one is
ever going to read it, attempted to summarize below in a more accessible
fashion.

The [Standard Model][sm] of particle physics is one of the most accurate
theories humans have ever come up with, describing nature almost exactly as we
observe it. Yet, for all its accuracy, we know it is still incomplete, and
even in the more complete areas there are regions where it is very difficult
to calculate what will happen. One of these regions is low energy [quantum
chromodynamics (QCD)][qcd]. This is the part of the theory that handles the
interaction of [protons][p], [neutrons][n], the [quarks][q] that make them up,
and the [gluons][g] that bind them together.

For [my thesis][thesis], I studied the interaction $$pp \to Z \to e^-e^+$$,
that is, two protons colliding to produce a [Z boson][z] which then decays to
two [electrons][e].[^1] This lets us explore the low energy QCD region (the
$$pp$$ collision) using particles (the $$e^-e^+$$ pair) which do not have any
messy QCD interactions to confound the data. More specifically, I looked at
the transverse momentum, $$Q_T$$, of the Z boson, or how much the boson was
moving in the direction transverse to the proton beams at the time it decayed.

### The Large Hadron Collider and the Compact Muon Solenoid

The [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)][lhc] is a very large, and very high energy,
particle collider on the boarder between Switzerland and France. It takes
protons and accelerates them along a circular track until they are traveling
close to the speed of light, and then smashes them together. This creates a
region of space with a lot of energy which is dissipated by creating new
particles.

Looking at these collisions allows us to test the Standard Model at very high
energies where undiscovered particles may exist. Multiple smaller particle
accelerators feed into the LHC (as shown below) and act like on-ramps, getting
the particles up-to-speed before they enter the LHC. The LHC hosts four major
experiments: [ATLAS][atlas]; [ALICE][alice]; [LHCb][lhcb]; and [CMS][cms], the
Compact Muon Solenoid, which was my experiment.

CMS is a 14,000 ton experiment run by nearly 3000 physicists and engineers. It
is built around a point on the LHC where protons collide and measures the
speed, mass, and flight direction of all the particles that are created after
the two protons collide. Some people like to think of it as a very large
camera, and that actually isn't so bad an analogy: like a camera, CMS measures
particles using silicon (and some other materials) and saves the output
somewhere to be viewed later.

The cutaway above shows the detector (with silhouette for scale).[^2] The
collision point is in the center. The detector is built in layers around this
collision point, with each layer designed to measure a different property of a
particle. By combining the measurements from all the layers we can tell which
particles were created and what direction they traveled in.

Doing research with the data generated by CMS has some subtleties, but it is
essentially just counting. We predict how many events with a certain
characteristic, for example containing two high energy electrons, we should
see based on our understanding of the Standard Model. Then we count the number
of events that CMS recorded with those characteristics and compare the data to
our prediction.

### Transverse Momentum

I said I studied low energy QCD, but then immediately introduced the highest
energy collider in the world. This is not, as it turns out, a contradiction.
While the LHC is very high energy, all that energy is directed along the
beamline; the protons have almost no energy transverse to the beamline,[^3]
and so this gives us the low energy QCD system that we desire. The $$Z \to
ee$$ decay is a great way to study this low energy regime because neither the
Z nor the electrons interact via QCD, so the only QCD effects in the decay
chain are from the initial proton-proton collision. This makes it an easy to
measure signal.

I measured the transverse momentum, $$Q_T$$, of the Z boson, which describes
the way the boson moves just before it decays. Measuring this not only tells
us about the low energy regime of QCD, but it also helps to constrain the mass
of the W boson, which is otherwise hard to measure. The W mass is interesting
because it helps determine some fundamental quantities in the Standard Model,
and because there is some disagreement between the measured value and the
predicted value.

But actually, I didn't measure $$Q_T$$, I measured a new variable called
$$\phi^{*}$$, which measures the same effect as $$Q_T$$, but is more robust
against shortcomings in the detector design. $$\phi^{*}$$ measures the angle
between the two electrons instead of their energy, which is easier to measure
accurately due to the design of CMS.

### Backgrounds, Event Selection, and Other Issues

The events I was interested in had two electrons in them, but not every event
with two electrons comes from a Z decay. Events that produce two electrons for
other reasons are called _background_ events, and the primary difficulty in
any high energy experiment is separating the background from the events we are
interested in, called _signal_ events. We use simple selection rules, called
_cuts_, to select the events we want. This selection happens in two stages:

1. As the collisions are happening in the detector (at a rate of 40 million
   times a second), a fast data processing system called the trigger applies
   very simple cuts to select interesting events out of the huge number of
   uninteresting ones.
2. After the data has been saved to disk, I apply a more precise set of cuts
   to select just the events that I think are likely to come from the $$Z \to
   ee$$ decay.

For example, in that second set of cuts I required two electrons, one with
very high energy and in the middle of the detector (where we get the most
accurate measurement), and one other with a little less energy anywhere in the
detector. Even with this selection some background events slip through;
figuring out how many is most of the work done in my thesis, because when we
count up events, we naturally do not want to include the background.

The way we try to figure out what the background looks like is through [Monte
Carlo experiments (MC)][mc] where we generate virtual data using the math
prescribed by the Standard Model. We tune this generated data on other
particle decays that look similar to, but are not, the ones we are interested
in. For example, since I cared about double electron events, we tuned our MC
on events with one electron and one [muon][muon] (which is very much like an
electron, but heavier).

Below is an example of what the MC predicted the signal (blue) and backgrounds
(everything else) would look like for my experiment. The black points are all
the events selected for the analysis, so you can see the agreement is not
perfect.

There were other issues to work through as well, like estimating how good CMS
was at measuring various things. These biases were mostly corrected or
estimated by using MC events and putting them through the analysis pipeline.
This lets us check what the analysis would have measured, while having
information about the true underlying event.

### Results

The results of six years of my life are shown in the (absolutely hideous, I
confess) plot below:

{% capture result %}{{ file_dir }}/final_result.svg{% endcapture %}

  image_alt='A plot showing the final result comparing the measured
    phi star distribution to the distributions predicted by various QCD Monte
    Carlo simulations.'
  caption='A plot showing the final result comparing the
    measured \(\phi^*\) distribution to the distributions predicted by various
    QCD Monte Carlo simulations.'
%}

Each collection of points in the top plot is a count of the events, for a
specific bin in $$\phi^*$$. The black points are the count of events seen in
CMS, and the colored points are the number of events predicted by various
Monte Carlo generator programs that use different approximations of the
Standard Model. The bottom plot is the ratio of MC events over observed
events. If the generators were perfectly simulating reality, all the points
would be right at 1, but of course they are not perfect so the points drift up
and down. The blue points (from the [MadGraph][madgraph]) do the best job, but
even they miss by up to 5%.

## In Summary

So that's it! I measured the angle between pairs of electrons in the CMS
detector, and compared it to the angle predicted by the Standard Model. The
result can be used to fine-tune the Monte Carlo generators we use so that
future measurements have better estimates. But will my result be used for
that? It's unclear.

I graduated quickly without publishing the results of my thesis in a journal.
In fact, my thesis was embargoed for six months to let my adviser and post doc
tidy it up for publication, but various complications ultimately prevented
that from happening.

That is the reality of scientific research though: spending years of your life
chasing down a subject cared about by only a handful of people. That is part
of the reason I wanted to write this post, in the hope that more than a
handful of people would read it, and learn about what I did.
