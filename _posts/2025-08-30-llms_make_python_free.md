    A watercolor cartoon illustration of a cheerful robot giving away free
    pythons. On the left, a smiling light-blue robot with antennae stands
    behind a wooden counter with a cash register that displays "$0." A sign
    next to the register reads, "HAPPY PYTHONS - FREE!" The robot has one arm
    outstretched towards the right, where a small market stall with a striped
    awning stands. The stall has two shelves filled with small, colorful, and
    smiling cartoon pythons in various patterns and colors, including green,
    yellow, orange, and blue. The background is entirely white.
