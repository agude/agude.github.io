Lab41 just finished [**Pelops**][pelops], a _vehicle re-identification
project_ using data from fixed video cameras. [Last time I talked about
"chipping"][chipping], that is extracting an image of a vehicle from a frame
of video automatically. We found that background subtraction worked OK based
on the small amount of labeled data we had.

In this post I'll go over the rest of the pipeline: **feature extraction** and
**vehicle matching**.

## Feature Extraction

Machine learning algorithms operate on a vector of numbers. An image can be
thought of as a vector of numbers---three numbers to define the color of each
pixel---but it turns out that taking these numbers and transforming them gives
a more [useful representation][vis]. This step of taking an image and creating
a vector of useful numbers is called feature extraction. We performed feature
extraction using several different algorithms.

[vis]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_descriptor

Our first method of feature extraction was an old one: Histogram of Oriented
Gradients or HOG. HOG was first proposed in the 80s, but has since found uses
in identifying pedestrians and was used by our sister lab [CosmiQ
Works][cosmiq] to [identify boat headings][boats]. HOG effectively counts the
number and direction of edges it finds in an image, and as such is useful for
finding specific objects. HOG lacks color information, so in addition to the
output from HOG, we appended a histogram of each color channel.

Our second method of feature extraction was based on deep learning. We took
[ResNet50][resnet] trained on [ImageNet][in], removed the fully connected
layers, and treated the 2048-dimension output of the convolutional layers as
our feature vector. [It is well known that networks trained on ImageNet,
despite being exceptionally good at identifying dogs and cats, are also very
good for general image problems][transfer]. It turns out the edges, shapes,
and colors learned for dogs are also, in different configurations, useful for
cars. For more details on the ResNet architecture, see my reading group blog
post.

Our third method of feature extraction was a [fine-tuned][transfer] ResNet50.
Pretrained networks are good at general image tasks, but they can be
"fine-tuned" to perform better on specific tasks. For Pelops that specific
task was make, model, and color identification of cars in a labeled dataset.
It is hoped that making the model better at make, model, and color detection
will generate features that are more useful for matching cars. This makes
intuitive sense: any human matching cars would use make, model, and color as
primary features.

## Matching

Once all of the vehicles have feature vectors associated with them, those
vectors can be used to match vehicles to each other. There are a few ways to
do this, starting with the simplest, which is to calculate a distance between
the vectors. This works great if the feature extractors are designed to make
the distance meaningful, but this is not generally the case. Neural networks
can have cost functions based on distance, but ResNet50 does not. So this
method, while attractive in simplicity, is not a good solution.

The second possible way of matching is to train a traditional (that is,
non-deep learning based) classifier. We trained a logistic regression model, a
random forest, and a support vector machine on top of each of the types of
feature vectors. Each model was given two feature vectors and asked to
classify them as coming from the same vehicle, or not. The training data was
balanced so that there were as many positive as negative examples. The best
accuracy these models achieved was 80%, although most struggled to pass 70%.
Accuracy is the number of true results divided by the number of total items
tested.

The third method of matching was to use a neural network as a classifier. Once
we added a deep learning classifier on top of our deep learning feature
extractor, we had a Siamese neural network. For details about how we trained
such a network, and for an overview of its architecture, see our blog post
here. The Siamese network performs the feature extraction and matching in one
step, and so allows optimizing both portions at the same time. This
arrangement achieved the best results by far, hitting nearly 93% accuracy on
our test set.

## Results

### Dataset

In order to determine how well our various feature extraction and matching
algorithms did, we needed a labeled dataset. We used the [VeRi dataset][veri],
which contains pictures of 776 uniquely identified vehicles. There are
multiple pictures of each vehicle taken from 20 different traffic cameras in
China. An example of two VeRi images is show below.

  Publishing, 2016: 869â€“884."

This dataset allowed us to test our performance on essentially the exact task
we were hoping to solve: re-identifying the same vehicle if it passed another
camera.

### Metric

The final metric we used is a cumulative matching curve (CMC). A CMC is
constructed as follows: 10 vehicles are selected in one set, and 10 in
another. These two sets have one car in common that is the correct match. The
algorithms then rank all 100 pairwise comparisons by confidence that they are
the same vehicles. The rank of the correct pair on this list of 100 pairs is
recorded. This trial is repeated for many randomly selected sets. The curve is
generated by recording what fraction of trials have the correct pair ranked at
a certain position or better.

  caption="Comparison of three matching methods with a random baseline using a cumulative matching curve."

The CMC plot shows the final Siamese network compared to HOG + Color Histogram
using euclidean distance, ResNet50 with euclidean distance, and a purely
random selection of matches. The sharp rise in the Siamese CMC is because it
is very good at matching on color, so all matches where the cars share the
same color appear near the top of the rankings. The slow rise after about rank
10 is due to cases where color was not very helpful in making the match,
either because the car was a very common color, or because it was a color
easily mistaken for another (for example, yellow and white are hard for the
network to tell apart).
