Although I have a [standing desk][desk_review], I still spend more than half
of my day sitting. The secondhand office chair my brother-in-law gave me
during the pandemic was falling apart even before I got it, so after four
years, I decided to upgrade.

I tried multiple different chairs in person, and although my heart wanted an
Aeron, my sit-test (for 10 minutes) told me I should get a [Steelcase
Gesture][sc_gesture]. Giving me confidence was the fact that The Wirecutter
had rated it their [best chair][wirecutter], saying "This is one of the most
adjustable chairs available---anyone can make it comfortable, regardless of
their height or size." After eight months, I've decided they were wrong.

Overall, I am disappointed with the chair, which has an uncomfortable back,
poor recline, and arms that just don't get out of the way enough to get close
to my desk. I have replaced it with an Aeron Size C (which I love).

## My Chair

I bought a Steelcase Gesture with:

- Headrest
- Upholstered Wrap Back
- Cogent Lizard Upholstery (5S94)
- Platinum Metallic Frame
- Matching Base
- 360° Arms
- Lumbar Support
- Wheels for Carpet

The retail price for this chair is $1679, but I got it through my work's
office supplier for $1079.

## Headrest

I debated whether or not I wanted a headrest and finally decided to get one.
You can mostly fold it out of the way if you don't like it, so I figured I'd
rather give it a shot. It's fine. I use it when lounging but not when sitting
normally. I would not get it again because it is superfluous.

## Arms

One of the selling points of the Gesture is how flexible the arms are. They
are very easy to move, easier than the Aeron's, but I didn't find this to be a
great selling point. Generally, I set the arms once and leave them forever. I
don't adjust them for each new position or task as Steelcase assumes.

Additionally, the arms aren't as nice as the Aeron's. The Gesture's arms don't
go as low, about 6 1/2 inches off the seat compared to 5 1/2 for the Aeron.
This is extremely important to me because I have very long arms. The Gesture's
arms also stick out further when pushed all the way back (10 inches from the
back of the chair, compared to 8 for the Aeron). This makes it harder to pull
the chair under a desk to get close to your keyboard. The pads are a little
thinner on the Gesture, making it slightly less comfortable.

## The Back

The Gesture has a very upright back. It forces me into a very straight
position, even though I normally prefer a little bit of recline. The back
moves in two ways: it tilts top to bottom to try to adjust to the curve of
your spine, and it reclines.

The back is also very tall, extending about 24 inches above the seat (not
including the headrest). Because it is very straight, it makes contact with my
shoulder blades in a way I found uncomfortable. For the first week of use, I
got upper back pain which I assumed was just my body adjusting to "sitting
correctly". Eight months later and I'm not so sure; the upper-back pain
persists (although far less severe) and my doctor thinks my posture is most of
the problem. I had no problem before using the Gesture.

### Recline

The Gesture's back can be locked into 4 different positions, and the spring
tension can be adjusted from "you can't push this back if you tried" to
"absolutely no resistance". Unfortunately, the recline just doesn't feel very
good on my chair. It is either too stiff, or too loose. There is no middle
ground that feels supportive. I think my spring is broken, because the
Gestures we have at my office have more better tension.

The back moves separate from the seat, which feels OK. On the Aeron, the seat
slides a bit when you recline which feels more natural. Overall, the recline
on the Aeron feels much better.

### Lumbar

The lumbar support is **TERRIBLE**. It pokes me in the back and feels like
it's trying to push me out of the chair. The curve of the backrest is already
aggressive, and the lumbar support makes it more so. There is an [entire
thread on Reddit][reddit][^reddit] about how the lumbar support ruins the
chair. I followed [Steelcase's guide to removing the lumbar support][pdf] and
it helped a lot (but I still didn't find it comfortable). I would not buy the
lumbar support again.

## The Seat

The seat depth is adjustable. Because I'm tall (6 foot 1 inch), I have the
seat all the way forward. This leaves a small gap between the back of the seat
and the backrest. The height is also adjustable, and I can make it high enough
to fit me.

Some people complain that the woven and padded seat retains heat and isn't
comfortable on hot days. I used the chair during the summer and didn't notice
heat problems, even when it was 110 °F outside and a little over 80 °F in my
office.

## Final Thoughts

I don't like my Steelcase Gesture. In the past, when I walked into my office
in the morning, I'd get a sinking feeling knowing I'd have to sit in it. After
about eight months, I've replaced it with an Aeron and couldn't be happier.
