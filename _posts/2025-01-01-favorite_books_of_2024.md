In 2024 I finished 46 books and joined a sci-fi book club. The book club has
been a great way to branch out from the types of books I normally read. Just
like [last year][last_year], here are my favorite books from 2024:

[last_year]: {% post_url 2024-01-01-favorite_books_of_2023 %}#blindsight-by-peter-watts

## <cite class="book-title">Echopraxia</cite> by <span class="author-name">Peter Watts</span>

{% capture ff1 %}{% include book_link.html title="Blindsight" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture ff2 %}{% include book_link.html title="Echopraxia" %}{% endcapture %} 

{% capture watts %}{% include author_link.html name="Petter Watts" link_text="Watts" %}{% endcapture %}

{{ ff2 }} is the sequel to {{ ff1 }}, one of my [favorite books from last
year][last_year]. Although it wasn't as well received by readers, it was my
favorite read of the year, and in fact I liked it _more_ than {{ blindsight }}
because of it's complicated storyline, interesting characters, and wider view
of the world it gives.

## The <span class="book-series">Culture</span> Series by <span class="author-name">Iain M. Banks</span>

{% capture c1 %}{% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture c2 %}{% include book_link.html title="The Player of Games" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture c3 %}{% include book_link.html title="Use of Weapons" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture c6 %}{% include book_link.html title="Inversions" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture c9 %}{% include book_link.html title="Surface Detail" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture c10 %}{% include book_link.html title="The Hydrogen Sonata" %}{% endcapture %}

{% capture culture %}{% include series_link.html series="Culture" %}{% endcapture %}

{% capture banks %}{% include author_link.html name="Iain M. Banks" link_text="Banks" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture bankss %}{% include author_link.html name="Iain M. Banks" link_text="Banks" possessive=true %}{% endcapture %}

I **hated** {{ c1 }} when I read it in 2023, but I gave the {{ culture }}
series another chance because I had spent the better part of two decades
waiting to get my hands on the books. I'm glad I did because I read {{ c2 }}
with my book club and loved it! My favorite from the series was {{ c9 }}
followed closely by {{ c3 }}. I even loved {{ c6 }}, one of the least well
reviewed of {{ bankss }}. It will be bittersweet when I finish the series with
{{ c10 }} in 2025.

## <cite class="book-title">A Fire Upon The Deep</cite> by <span class="author-name">Vernor Vinge</span>

{%include book_link.html title="A Fire Upon The Deep" %} is a nostalgic
favorite that I first read about 20 years ago, and just reread this year for
my book club. It does a fantastic job of a telling a story that is small and
personal while at the same time having galaxy spanning implications. The zones
of thought are also a unique idea about how the galaxy is structured and how
it would impact what civilizations can develop.

## The <span class="book-series">Cheela</span> Series by <span class="author-name">Robert L. Forward</span>

{% capture ch1 %}{% include book_link.html title="Dragon's Egg" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture ch2 %}{% include book_link.html title="Starquake" %}{% endcapture %} 

{% capture cheela %}{% include series_link.html series="Cheela" %}{% endcapture %}

{% capture forward %}{% include author_link.html name="Robert L. Forward" link_text="Forward" %}{% endcapture %}

The {{ cheela }} series is composed of two hard sci-fi novels by {{ forward
}}: {{ ch1 }} and {{ ch2 }}. Even though the Cheela are _extremely_
alien---living on the surface of a neutron star, experience time a million
times faster than humans---the characters still pulled me in. It was exciting
watching them build their civilization up from hunter-gatherer to space
faring.

## <cite class="book-title">Childhood's End</cite> by <span class="author-name">Arthur C. Clarke</span>

{% capture end %}{% include book_link.html title="Childhood's End" %}{% endcapture %} 

{% capture clarkes %}{% include author_link.html name="Arthur C. Clarke" link_text="Clarke" possessive=true %}{% endcapture %}

Another nostalgic read, {{ clarkes }} {{ end }} was one of the first sci-fi
books I read, it was a treat to revisit it years later and see that it held
up. The focus on humans' psychic ability feels a little dated, but {{ clarkes
}} crisp writing kept me engaged.
