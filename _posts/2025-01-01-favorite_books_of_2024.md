In 2024, I finished 46 books and joined a sci-fi book club. The club has been
a fantastic way to explore books outside my usual reading habits and has
encouraged me to think more critically about writing, thematic connections,
and the author's intent---so I have plenty to share during discussions.
Following the tradition of [last year's post][last_year], here are my favorite
reads from 2024:

[last_year]: {% post_url 2024-01-01-favorite_books_of_2023 %}#blindsight-by-peter-watts

## <cite class="book-title">Echopraxia</cite> by <span class="author-name">Peter Watts</span>

{% capture ff1 %}{% include book_link.html title="Blindsight" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture ff2 %}{% include book_link.html title="Echopraxia" %}{% endcapture %} 

{% capture watts %}{% include author_link.html name="Petter Watts" link_text="Watts" %}{% endcapture %}

{{ ff2 }} is the sequel to {{ ff1 }}, one of my [favorite books from last
year][last_year]. Although it wasn't as well received by readers as {{ ff1 }},
it was my favorite read of the year. In fact, I liked it _more_ than {{ ff1 }}
because of its complex storyline, intriguing characters, and the broader
perspective it offers on the world.

## The <span class="book-series">Culture</span> Series by <span class="author-name">Iain M. Banks</span>

{% capture c1 %}{% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture c2 %}{% include book_link.html title="The Player of Games" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture c3 %}{% include book_link.html title="Use of Weapons" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture c6 %}{% include book_link.html title="Inversions" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture c9 %}{% include book_link.html title="Surface Detail" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture c10 %}{% include book_link.html title="The Hydrogen Sonata" %}{% endcapture %}

{% capture culture %}{% include series_link.html series="Culture" %}{% endcapture %}

{% capture banks %}{% include author_link.html name="Iain M. Banks" link_text="Banks" %}{% endcapture %}
{% capture bankss %}{% include author_link.html name="Iain M. Banks" link_text="Banks" possessive=true %}{% endcapture %}

I **hated** {{ c1 }} when I read it in 2023, but I gave the {{ culture }}
series another chance because I had spent the better part of two decades
waiting to get my hands on the books. I'm glad I did, because I read {{ c2 }}
with my book club and loved it! My favorite from the series was {{ c9 }},
closely followed by {{ c3 }}. I even enjoyed {{ c6 }}, one of the least
well-reviewed of {{ bankss }} books. It will be bittersweet to finish the
series with {{ c10 }} in 2025.

## <cite class="book-title">A Fire Upon The Deep</cite> by <span class="author-name">Vernor Vinge</span>

{% include book_link.html title="A Fire Upon The Deep" %} is a nostalgic
favorite that I first read about 20 years ago and reread this year for my book
club. It does a fantastic job of telling a story that feels small and personal
while having galaxy-spanning implications. The Zones of Thought concept is
also a unique way to structure the galaxy and explore how it shapes
civilizations.

## The <span class="book-series">Cheela</span> Series by <span class="author-name">Robert L. Forward</span>

{% capture ch1 %}{% include book_link.html title="Dragon's Egg" %}{% endcapture %} 
{% capture ch2 %}{% include book_link.html title="Starquake" %}{% endcapture %} 

{% capture cheela %}{% include series_link.html series="Cheela" %}{% endcapture %}

{% capture forward %}{% include author_link.html name="Robert L. Forward" link_text="Forward" %}{% endcapture %}

The {{ cheela }} series consists of two hard sci-fi novels by {{ forward }}:
{{ ch1 }} and {{ ch2 }}. Even though the Cheela are _extremely_ alien---living
on the surface of a neutron star and experiencing time a million times faster
than humans---their characters still pulled me in. It was exciting to watch
them build their civilization from hunter-gatherers to a spacefaring society.

## <cite class="book-title">Childhood's End</cite> by <span class="author-name">Arthur C. Clarke</span>

{% capture end %}{% include book_link.html title="Childhood's End" %}{% endcapture %} 

{% capture clarkes %}{% include author_link.html name="Arthur C. Clarke" link_text="Clarke" possessive=true %}{% endcapture %}

Another nostalgic read, {{ clarkes }} {{ end }} was one of the first sci-fi
books I ever read. Revisiting it years later was a treat, and I'm happy to say
it holds up. The focus on humans' psychic abilities feels a little dated, but
{{ clarkes }} crisp writing kept me engaged.
