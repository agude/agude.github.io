I read with dismay this morning the Daily Cal article [<cite
class="newspaper">>UC Berkeley turns over personal information of more than
150 students and staff to federal government</cite>][cal]. I find it hard to
believe you have misunderstood our place in the world so badly as to comply
with an illegal, fascist witch hunt.

What is the point of studying history if we learn nothing from it? What is the
point of our own history if we simply repeat the same mistakes we made in the
past?

We tell ourselves myths about Mario Savio and the Free Speech Movement, about
the little circle of freedom in front of Sproul Hall, about how that history
determined who we are now. But it is clear to me that if you were the 1960s
administration, you would have made the exact same decisions.

You believe you're saving the University. But you have destroyed its soul.
