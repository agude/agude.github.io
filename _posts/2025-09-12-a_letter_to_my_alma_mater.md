It was with dismay this morning that I read the Daily Cal article: [<cite
class="newspaper">UC Berkeley turns over personal information of more than 150
students and staff to federal government</cite>][cal]. That you, the
inheritors of this university's mantle, would willingly comply with a
political witch hunt reveals a profound and stunning ignorance of the
historical moment we are in.

Your failure of courage raises some fundamental questions. What is the point
of studying history if we learn nothing from it? What is the point of our own
history if we simply repeat the same mistakes we made in the past?

We tell ourselves myths about Mario Savio and the Free Speech Movement, about
the little circle of freedom in front of Sproul Hall, about how that history
determined who we are now. But it is clear now that you have chosen to betray
that legacy, siding not with Savio, but with the machine he warned us about:

> There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes
> you so sick at heart that you can't take part! You can't even passively take
> part! And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels,
> upon the levers, upon all the apparatus---and you've got to make it stop!

You believe you're saving the University by complying. But you have destroyed
its soul.
