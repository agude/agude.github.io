title: A Letter to my Alma Mater
description: >
    In a stunning failure of courage, UC Berkeley has turned over the personal
    information of students and staff to the federal government. This decision
    is a profound betrayal of the university's legacy, particularly the Free
    Speech Movement. This is my letter to the administration.

It was with dismay this morning that I read the Daily Cal article: [<cite
class="newspaper">UC Berkeley turns over personal information of more than 150
students and staff to federal government</cite>][cal]. That you, the
inheritors of this university's mantle, would willingly comply with a
political witch hunt reveals a profound and stunning ignorance of the
historical moment we are in.

Your failure of courage raises some fundamental questions. What is the point
of studying history if we learn nothing from it? What is the point of our own
history if we simply repeat the same mistakes we made in the past?

We tell ourselves myths about Mario Savio and the Free Speech Movement, about
the little circle of freedom in front of Sproul Hall, about how that history
determined who we are now. But it is clear now that you have chosen to betray
that legacy, siding not with Savio, but with the machine he warned us about.
You aren't willing to put your careers, never mind your bodies, upon the
wheels and levers to make it stop.

You believe you're saving the University. But you are destroying its soul.
