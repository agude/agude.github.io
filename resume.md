## Alexander Gude

Senior Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer

https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandergude

### Statement

Data scientist with 5 years of experience in direct, customer-facing
engagements and shipping data science and ma- chine learning products. Led
teams in adopting engineering best practices for code review and CI/CD
pipelines and drove transition to enterprise technologies to save in operation
costs, reduce production bugs, and accelerate feature processing.

### Experience

#### Cash App, of Block Inc.

Remote

Staff Machine Learning Engineer, Modeler 2020--Present
 
#### Intuit

Mountain View, CA

Staff Data Scietist / Senior Data Science Manager 2017--2020

- Led 8 data scientists in building machine learning models to detect and stop
  fraud.
- Drove adoption of engineering best practices by the team, including
  implementation of peer review for code changes and automated correctness
  checking, building of CI/CD pipelines for code and model deployment, and
  added metrics around test coverage and code health, reducing number of P0
  production bugs from 2 in the first year to 0.
- Deployed the first in-product, real-time account takeover prevention model
  at Intuit---launched in production in TurboTax and alerted security to a
  possible breach within the first week of running. Back-testing showed it
  would have detected 95% of last year's stolen tax return downloads.
- Drove migration of machine learning models from Intuit's on-prem data center
  to AWS platform without interruption of services, saving $1.5M per year in
  operation costs.
- Improved the TurboTax Online account takeover model leading to a 90%
  reduction in wrongly challenged users, stopping 10X as many fraudsters, and
  shortening feature processing time from 2 hours to under a second.

#### Lab41, an In-Q-Tel Lab
Menlo Park, CA

Data Scientist 2015--2017

- Led a team of 3 engineers in investigating the latest computer vision
  techniques for vehicle re-identification using deep learning and develop a
  system within 6 months that enabled clients to automatically detect the same
  vehicle across multiple videos from security cameras. Handed over the new
  system to customer's internal development team and provided training.
- Worked as part of a team of 3 scientists to develop an embedding technique
  to train a convolutional neural network on unlabeled, open-source image
  data. Built a system using TensorFlow that learned to embed images and text
  into a joint vector space, allowing customers to perform content-based image
  retrieval on a corpus of 100M untagged images.
- Designed and implemented a recommender system evaluation framework in Python
  and Spark and leveraged it to develop a Python-snippet recommender using
  word embeddings.
