I need you to refactor the following Ruby file to fix RuboCop static analysis errors and improve general code quality.

FILE: _plugins/utils/url_utils.rb

THE ERRORS TO FIX:
- Line 6: [Metrics/AbcSize] Assignment Branch Condition size for `absolute_url` is too high. [<12, 24, 16> 31.24/17]
- Line 6: [Metrics/CyclomaticComplexity] Cyclomatic complexity for `absolute_url` is too high. [14/7]
- Line 6: [Metrics/MethodLength] Method has too many lines. [20/10]
- Line 6: [Metrics/PerceivedComplexity] Perceived complexity for `absolute_url` is too high. [15/8]


STYLE GUIDE & REFACTORING PATTERNS:
1. **Complex Logic Extraction (Tags/Classes):**
   - If a method (like `render`) is too complex, extract the logic into a private helper class defined within the same module/class.
   - **Pattern:**
     ```ruby
     def render(context)
       MyTagRenderer.new(context).render
     end

     # Helper class to handle rendering logic
     class MyTagRenderer
       def initialize(context)
         @context = context
         @site = context.registers[:site]
       end

       def render
         # logic here
       end
     end
     ```

2. **Stateless Utilities (Modules):**
   - For utility modules, keep methods static (`def self.method`).
   - Break complex logic into private class methods named with a leading underscore.
   - **Pattern:**
     ```ruby
     def self.public_method(arg)
       _private_helper(arg)
     end

     def self._private_helper(arg)
       # logic
     end
     ```

3. **General Quality:**
   - Fix "bad code" or poor style even if RuboCop misses it (e.g., redundant logic, unclear variable names, deeply nested conditionals).
   - Ensure `# frozen_string_literal: true` is at the top.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Fix the specific RuboCop errors listed above.
2. Apply the Refactoring Patterns defined in the Style Guide.
3. Improve readability and maintainability generally.
4. **CRITICAL:** DO NOT change the external behavior or API of the code.
5. DO NOT remove comments unless they are the specific "rubocop:disable" comments causing issues.
6. Return the FULL content of the fixed file.

SOURCE CODE:
```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# _plugins/utils/url_utils.rb

module UrlUtils
  def self.absolute_url(path, site)
    return nil if path.nil?

    path_str = path.to_s

    # Return immediately if path_str is already a full URL
    return path_str if path_str.start_with?('http://', 'https://')

    site_url = site.config['url'].to_s.chomp('/')
    baseurl  = site.config['baseurl'].to_s # Don't chomp here initially

    # Normalize baseurl: remove leading/trailing slashes, then add a leading one if not empty
    normalized_baseurl = baseurl.gsub(%r{^/+|/+$}, '')
    normalized_baseurl = "/#{normalized_baseurl}" unless normalized_baseurl.empty?

    # Normalize path: remove leading slashes, then add a leading one if not empty
    # unless it's an empty string (which means we want the base or site URL)
    normalized_path = path_str.gsub(%r{^/+}, '')
    if !normalized_path.empty? || path_str == '/' # if original path was "/" or non-empty after stripping
      normalized_path = "/#{normalized_path}"
    elsif path_str.empty? && !normalized_baseurl.empty?
      # If path is empty but baseurl exists, we want the baseurl path, often ending in /
      # The join later will handle this. If baseurl is just "/", normalized_baseurl will be "/".
      # If path is empty, normalized_path should be empty so baseurl is the target.
      normalized_path = '' # Ensure it's empty if original path was empty
    elsif path_str.empty? && normalized_baseurl.empty?
      # Path and baseurl are empty, target is site_url + "/"
      return "#{site_url}/"
    end

    # Combine parts, then clean up slashes
    full_path = "#{site_url}#{normalized_baseurl}#{normalized_path}"

    # Replace multiple slashes (except in protocol) with a single slash
    # And ensure a trailing slash if the original path was empty or just "/"
    # and the result is just the domain or domain + baseurl.
    final_url = full_path.gsub(%r{(?<!:)/+}, '/')

    # Add trailing slash if the effective path component is empty or just baseurl
    # (i.e., original path was "" or "/")
    final_url += '/' if (path_str.empty? || path_str == '/') && !final_url.end_with?('/')
    # Special case: if the result is just the site_url (e.g. https://example.com), ensure it has a trailing slash
    final_url = "#{site_url}/" if final_url == site_url

    final_url
  end
end
```
