I need you to refactor the following Ruby file to fix RuboCop static analysis errors.

FILE: _plugins/utils/feed_utils.rb

THE ERRORS TO FIX:
- Line 13: [Metrics/AbcSize] Assignment Branch Condition size for `get_combined_feed_items` is too high. [<5, 27, 10> 29.22/17]
- Line 13: [Metrics/CyclomaticComplexity] Cyclomatic complexity for `get_combined_feed_items` is too high. [9/7]
- Line 13: [Metrics/MethodLength] Method has too many lines. [15/10]
- Line 13: [Metrics/PerceivedComplexity] Perceived complexity for `get_combined_feed_items` is too high. [9/8]


INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Fix the specific errors listed above.
2. If the error is "Metrics/MethodLength" or "Metrics/AbcSize", please extract logic into private helper methods.
3. If the error is "Style/FrozenStringLiteralComment", add the comment to the top of the file.
4. DO NOT change the external behavior of the code.
5. DO NOT remove comments unless they are the specific "rubocop:disable" comments causing issues.
6. Return the FULL content of the fixed file.

SOURCE CODE:
```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# _plugins/utils/feed_utils.rb
# No specific requires needed from other utils for this basic version,
# but PluginLoggerUtils could be added if logging within the util becomes necessary.

module FeedUtils
  # Combines posts and books, sorts them by date, and returns a limited number.
  #
  # @param site [Jekyll::Site] The Jekyll site object.
  # @param limit [Integer] The maximum number of items to return.
  # @return [Array<Jekyll::Document>] An array of Jekyll documents (posts or books).
  def self.get_combined_feed_items(site:, limit: 5)
    all_items = []

    # Process posts
    if site.posts&.docs.is_a?(Array)
      posts = site.posts.docs.select do |post|
        post.data['published'] != false && post.date.is_a?(Time)
      end
      all_items.concat(posts)
    end

    # Process books
    if site.collections['books']&.docs.is_a?(Array)
      books = site.collections['books'].docs.select do |book|
        book.data['published'] != false && book.date.is_a?(Time)
      end
      all_items.concat(books)
    end

    # Sort all collected items by date, most recent first
    all_items.sort_by!(&:date).reverse!

    # Return the limited number of items
    all_items.slice(0, limit)
  end
end
```
