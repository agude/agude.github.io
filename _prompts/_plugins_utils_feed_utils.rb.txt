I need you to refactor the following Ruby file to fix RuboCop static analysis errors and improve general code quality.

FILE: _plugins/utils/feed_utils.rb

THE ERRORS TO FIX:
- Line 13: [Metrics/AbcSize] Assignment Branch Condition size for `get_combined_feed_items` is too high. [<5, 27, 10> 29.22/17]
- Line 13: [Metrics/CyclomaticComplexity] Cyclomatic complexity for `get_combined_feed_items` is too high. [9/7]
- Line 13: [Metrics/MethodLength] Method has too many lines. [15/10]
- Line 13: [Metrics/PerceivedComplexity] Perceived complexity for `get_combined_feed_items` is too high. [9/8]


STYLE GUIDE & REFACTORING PATTERNS:
1. **Complex Logic Extraction (Tags/Classes):**
   - If a method (like `render`) is too complex, extract the logic into a private helper class defined within the same module/class.
   - **Pattern:**
     ```ruby
     def render(context)
       MyTagRenderer.new(context).render
     end

     # Helper class to handle rendering logic
     class MyTagRenderer
       def initialize(context)
         @context = context
         @site = context.registers[:site]
       end

       def render
         # logic here
       end
     end
     ```

2. **Stateless Utilities (Modules):**
   - For utility modules, keep methods static (`def self.method`).
   - Break complex logic into private class methods named with a leading underscore.
   - **Pattern:**
     ```ruby
     def self.public_method(arg)
       _private_helper(arg)
     end

     def self._private_helper(arg)
       # logic
     end
     ```

3. **General Quality:**
   - Fix "bad code" or poor style even if RuboCop misses it (e.g., redundant logic, unclear variable names, deeply nested conditionals).
   - Ensure `# frozen_string_literal: true` is at the top.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Fix the specific RuboCop errors listed above.
2. Apply the Refactoring Patterns defined in the Style Guide.
3. Improve readability and maintainability generally.
4. **CRITICAL:** DO NOT change the external behavior or API of the code.
5. DO NOT remove comments unless they are the specific "rubocop:disable" comments causing issues.
6. Return the FULL content of the fixed file.

SOURCE CODE:
```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# _plugins/utils/feed_utils.rb
# No specific requires needed from other utils for this basic version,
# but PluginLoggerUtils could be added if logging within the util becomes necessary.

module FeedUtils
  # Combines posts and books, sorts them by date, and returns a limited number.
  #
  # @param site [Jekyll::Site] The Jekyll site object.
  # @param limit [Integer] The maximum number of items to return.
  # @return [Array<Jekyll::Document>] An array of Jekyll documents (posts or books).
  def self.get_combined_feed_items(site:, limit: 5)
    all_items = []

    # Process posts
    if site.posts&.docs.is_a?(Array)
      posts = site.posts.docs.select do |post|
        post.data['published'] != false && post.date.is_a?(Time)
      end
      all_items.concat(posts)
    end

    # Process books
    if site.collections['books']&.docs.is_a?(Array)
      books = site.collections['books'].docs.select do |book|
        book.data['published'] != false && book.date.is_a?(Time)
      end
      all_items.concat(books)
    end

    # Sort all collected items by date, most recent first
    all_items.sort_by!(&:date).reverse!

    # Return the limited number of items
    all_items.slice(0, limit)
  end
end
```
