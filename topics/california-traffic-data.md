California maintains the _Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System_
(SWITRS) which contains information about every traffic incident reported to
the police from 2001 to 2020. I have used this dataset to do multiple analyses
and I even curate the dataset and host it on [Kaggle][kaggle] and
[Zenodo][zenodo] for easy access and download.
