# Alexander Gude

<div class="subtitle">Lucky Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer</div>

<br>

_Note:_ I wrote this resume chronologically so it tells a better story top to
bottom. My [**real resume**][resume] is in the more standard reverse
chronological order I recommend.

## Statement

I am a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at a major tech company. I finished my
PhD in high energy particle physics about {{ "now" | date: "%Y" | minus: 2015
}}  years ago. I started college {{ "now" | date: "%Y" | minus: 2004 }} years
ago sure I was going to be a physicist. It's been a winding journey, with now
small amount of lucky breaks. I wrote this resume to highlight all the times
something out of my control got me ahead in my career.

## Education

{% include resume_experience.html
  company="University of California, Berkeley"
  location="Berkeley, CA"
  position="BA, Physics (Honors), College of Letters and Sciences"
  dates="2004--2008"

  company="University of Minnesota"
  location="Minneapolis, MN"
  position="PhD, High Energy Particle Physics"
  dates="2009--2015"

- My [GRE score was pretty bad][rejection]. In 2008 I was rejected from every
  grad school I applied to. In 2009, Yuichi Kubota saw my application to
  Minnesota and thought "I think we can give him a shot". He did that for a
  lot of people my year.

## Experience

{% include resume_experience.html
  company="Supernova Cosmology Project"
  location="Berkeley, CA"
  position="Undergraduate Research Assistant"
  dates="2005-2009"
%}

- My friend's aunt worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs as en executive assistant.
  My resume got passed to her (I don't even recall how exactly) where it
  eventually found its way to the [Supernova Cosmology Project][scp] under
  Nobel prize winner [Saul Perlmutter][saul]. Saul's post doc, Nao Suzuki,
  wanted a research assistant and invited me up to the lab.
- Weirdly, and lucky for me, Nao had decided not to use [IDL][idl_is_bad], the
  standard language for astrophysics software, and instead wanted to work with
  Python. We used Numarray and Numeric (which would later become Numpy).

  company="Insight Data Science"
  location="Palo Alto, CA"
  position="Data Scientist Fellow"
  dates="2015"
%}

- In 2014 I was looking for what to do after I finished my PhD, having
  realized I did not want to go through the faculty lottery. One day I was
  looking through my saved bookmarks when I clicked on the link to a blog
  written by my former student instructor at Berkeley, [Jessica
  Kirkpatrick][jessica]. The top post was [_Career Profiles: Astronomer to Data
  Scientist_][jess_post].[^jk_post] Inside was a link to Insight Data Science
  which I clicked. I saw there were just two days until applications were due. I
  threw one together and was accepted to the program.
- My advisor told me there was no way I would graduate by January 2015 (he was
  right). I emailed Insight and asked if I could delay starting until the next
  session. They said yes. I have since learned their policy is not to do that.
  I'm glad someone made an exception.

  position="Staff Data Scientist / Senior Data Science Manager"
  dates="2017--2020"

- My manager and director both left Intuit within a short time period, leaving
  our team rudderless. It gave me to opportunity to step into a management
  role first unofficially, and then officially several months later.
