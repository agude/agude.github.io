<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It tells the story
of a spaceship carrying the children of two ambassadors that crashes on an
inhospitable planet, forcing humans to collaborate with the primitive native
aliens to rescue them.

Easy Rich,[^easy] the 12-year-old daughter of a human diplomat, and 'Mina, the
7-year-old son of a Drommian diplomat, crash-land on the planet Tenebra
following an almost immersion-breakingly improbable series of events that
starts with them playing in a spaceship and ends with them under an ocean of
sulfuric acid. With the planet too inhospitable for humans, the only people
who can help are the natives that the humans kidnapped 16 years before and
raised under the guidance of Fagin, the robotic lander. Complicating matters
are the (justifiably) strained relations between the humans and the Drommians,
caused by the humans' failure to keep the children safe in the first place.

[^easy]:
    Easy Rich has grown up and changed her name to Easy Hoffman in {{ star }};
    the only connection between {{ this_book }} and the rest of the {{ series
    }}.

{{ clement }} had trouble creating tension in the other two books of the {{
series }}: {{ mission }} and {{ star }}. In {{ this_book }} he does better by
creating an antagonist on the planet who works against the humans and their
allies. However, like in his other stories, the tension fades away quickly at
the end.

Once again, {{ clement }} prioritizes his "game"[^game] of world-building and
maintaining consistency over crafting a compelling narrative. The result is a
fine but not great book.

    Writing a science fiction story is fun, not work. [...] The fun, and the
    material for this article, lies in treating the whole thing as a game.
    I've been playing the game since I was a child, so the rules must be
    quite simple. They are; for the reader of a science-fiction story, they
    consist of finding as many as possible of the author's statements or
    implications which conflict with the facts as science currently
    understands them. For the author, the rule is to make as few such slips
    as he possibly can.
