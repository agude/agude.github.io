Easy Rich---the 12 year old daughter of a human diplomat---and 'Mina---the
7-ish year old son of a Drommian diplomat---crash land on the planet Tenebra
after a frankly unlikely series of events that starts with them playing in a
spaceship and ends with them under an ocean of sulfuric acid. The children are
in danger and need to be rescued from a planet that humans can't set foot on,
at the same time that diplomatic relations between the humans and the
Drommains are breaking down because of the (justified) perceived incompetence
of the humans the led to the situation. The only people who can help are the
natives that the humans kidnapped 16 years before and have been raising on the
planet, parented by the robotic lander Fagin.

{{ clement }} struggled to build tension in the other two books in the {{
series }}: {{ mission }} and {{ star }}. In {{ this_book }} he does better by
creating an antagonist on the planet opposed to the humans and their allies.
But like his other novels, the tension evaporates quickly near the end of the
book.

Once again {{ clement }} focuses on his game[^game] of inventing a world and
keeping it consistent at the expense of telling a compelling story. A fine
book, but not great.
