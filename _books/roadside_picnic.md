<span class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors[1] }}</span>, is a Soviet
sci-fi novel. It's essentially four short stories---each presented as a

enters an alien-contaminated Zone to retrieve items for the black market.

{{ this_book }} is a first-contact story like {{ war_of_the_worlds }} and {{
three_body }}. Both those books treat aliens as hostile and bent on conquering
humanity, but this book takes a different approach: the aliens are completely
indifferent to our existence. One of its main themes is that humanity is not
special. In that way, {{ this_book }} is closer to {{ blindsight }} and {{
echopraxia }}, where we encounter intelligences---Rorschach, the Vampires, the
Bicamerals---that are _completely_ alien, not even conscious in the human
sense, yet operating on a level far beyond our understanding.

Tied into this theme is our inability to understand, how some things are
unknown and unknowable. {{ the_authors_first_only }} never give the reader
anymore information than the characters have, and they never show us the
aliens. They don't even hint at what the Visitors might be like, other than by
showing us the incomprehensible items they left behind. Humans have no better
chance of understanding an Empty or the Golden Sphere than an ant has of
understanding a nuclear reactor. Red's daughter, the Monkey, fits this theme
too, becoming more and more alien as she grows old and losing the ability to
understand her parents at all.

{{ the_authors }} make the Zone feel dangerous and oppressive without
overdoing it. We only see the inside of the Zone twice: once at the very
start, when Red takes Dr. Kirill Panov to collect a full Empty, and again at
the end, when Red sacrifices Arthur to the grinder to make a wish at the
Golden Sphere. But the Zone looms over the entire novel, always feeling like
it's about to erupt onto the pages.

{{ this_book }} pays homage {{ wellss }} {{ war_of_the_worlds }} in more than
just being a first-contact story. {{ wellss }} Martians travel to Earth using
a giant canon. Dr. Pillman describes the Visitors' arrival by saying, "all six
Visit Zones are position on the surface of the planet like bullet holes made
by a gun located somewhere between Earth and Deneb." And like {{ wellss }}
Martians, the Visitors also landed in multiple places.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of others. The institute trying to contain and
study the Zone's artifacts recalls the SCP Foundation from {{ qntms }} {{
antimemetics }}. The rundown town with supernatural elements is like Revachol
in {{ disco_elysium }}. Alien trash appearing on Earth and being studied or
weaponized is the same theme as {{ bankss }} {{ cleaning }} from {{ art }}.
Red, the red-headed, freckled, anti-authority figure, reminded me of Rorschach
in {{ moore }} and {{ gibbonss }} {{ watchmen }}.

I really enjoyed {{ this_book }}, and I'll be reading more of {{
the_authors_possessive }} work. Their work has such a different feel from what
I'm used to with American and British sci-fi that it provides a nice break.
Next on to {{ bolo11 }}, {{ hyperion }}, and perhaps {{ lost }}.
