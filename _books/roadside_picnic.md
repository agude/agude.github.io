class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors[0] | split: " " | first }}</span> and
<span class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors[1] }}</span>, is a Soviet
sci-fi novel. It's essentially four short stories, each presented as a
chapter, about the life of Redrick "Red" Schuhart, a "stalker" who illegally
enters an alien-contaminated Zone to retrieve items for the black market.

{{ this_book }} is a first-contact story like {{ war_of_the_worlds }} and {{
three_body }}. Both those books treat aliens as hostile, looking to conquer
humanity, but this book takes a different approach: the aliens are completely
indifferent to humanity's existence. This is one of the main themes in the
work: that humanity is not special. In a way, {{ this_book }} is similar to {{
blindsight }} and {{ echopraxia }}, in which we make contact with
intelligences---Rorschach, the Vampires, the Bicamerals---that are
_completely_ alien, not even conscious, but operating on a level far beyond
out understanding.

Tied into this theme is our inability to understand, how some things are
unknown and unknowable. {{ the_authors_first_only }} never give the reader
anymore information than the characters have. And they never show us the
aliens. They don't even hint at what they're like, other than by showing us
the incomprehensible items they left behind. Humans have no more a chance of
understanding an Empty or the Golden Sphere than an ant does a nuclear
reactor. Red's daughter, the Monkey, fits this theme as well, as she becomes
more and more alien as she ages, losing the ability to understand her
parents.

{{ the_authors }} did a wonderful job of making the Zone feel dangerous and
oppressive, but without overdoing it. We only see the inside of the Zone
twice, once at the very beginning of the story when Red takes Dr. Kirill Panov
to collect a full Empty, and once at the end when Red sacrifices Arthur to the
grinder to make a wish at the Golden Sphere, but it has a heavy presence
through the entire novel, always feeling like it's about to erupt onto the
pages.

{{ this_book }} pays homage {{ wellss }} {{ war_of_the_worlds }} in more than
just being a first-contact story. {{ wellss }} martians travel to Earth using
a giant canon. Dr. Pillman describes where the {{ strugatskys }} Visitors came
from by saying "all six Visit Zones are position on the surface of the planet
like bullet holes made by a gun located somewhere between Earth and Deneb."
Like {{ wellss }} martians, the Visitors also landed in multiple places.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of others. The institute trying to contain and
study the Zone artifacts reminded me of the SCP foundation, which appeared in
{{ qntms }} {{ antimemetics }}. The rundown town with super natural beings is
like Revochol in {{ disco_elysium }}. Alien trash appearing on Earth and being
studied and turned into weapons is the same theme as {{ bankss }} {{ cleaning
}} from {{ art }}. Red, the red-headed, freckled, anti-authority figure
reminded me of Rorschach in {{ moores }} and {{ gibbonss }} {{ watchmen }}.
