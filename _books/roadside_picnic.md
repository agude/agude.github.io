{{ this_book }} is a first-contact story like {{ war_of_the_worlds }} and {{
three_body }}. Both those books treat aliens as hostile, looking to conquer
humanity, but this book takes a different approach: the aliens are completely
indifferent to humanity's existence. This is one of the main themes in the
work: that humanity is not special. In a way, {{ this_book }} similar to {{
blindsight }} and {{ echopraxia }}, in which we make contact with
intelligences---Rorschach, the Vampires, the Bicamerals---that are
_completely_ alien, not even conscious, but operating on a level far beyond
out understanding.

Tied into this theme is our inability to understand, how some things are
unknown and unknowable. {{ the_authors_first_only }} never give the reader
anymore information than the characters have. And they never show us the
aliens, or even hint at what they're like, other than by showing us the
incomprehensible items they left behind. Humans have no more a chance of
understanding an Empty or the Golden Sphere than an ant does a nuclear
reactor.

{{ the_authors }} did a wonderful job of making the Zone feel dangerous and
oppressive, but without overdoing it. We only see the inside of the Zone
twice, once at the very beginning of the story when Red takes Dr. Kirill Panov
to collect a full Empty, and once at the end when Red sacrifices Arthur to the
grinder to make a wish at the Golden Sphere, but it has a heavy prescence
through the entire novel, always feeling like it's about to erupt onto the
pages.

{{ this_book }} pays homage to {{ wellss }} {{ war_of_the_worlds }} in more
than just being an invasion book. In both stories the aliens arrive on Earth
as if shot by a cannon.

"all six Visit Zones are position on the surface of
the planet like bullet holes made by a gun located somewhere between Earth and
Deneb"
