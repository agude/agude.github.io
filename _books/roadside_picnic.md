class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors[0] | split: " " | first }}</span> and
<span class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors[1] }}</span>, is a Soviet
sci-fi novel. It's essentially four short stories---each presented as a
chapter---about the life of Redrick "Red" Schuhart, a "stalker" who illegally
enters an alien-contaminated Zone to retrieve items for the black market.

{{ this_book }} is a first-contact story like {{ war_of_the_worlds }} and {{
three_body }}. While both of those books treat aliens as hostile and bent on
conquering humanity, this book takes a different approach: the aliens are
completely indifferent to our existence. One of its main themes is that
humanity is not special. In that way, {{ this_book }} is closer to {{
blindsight }} and {{ echopraxia }}, where we encounter
intelligences---Rorschach, the Vampires, the Bicamerals---that are
_completely_ alien, not even conscious in the human sense, yet operating on a
level far beyond our understanding.

Tied into this theme is our inability to understand how some things are
unknown and unknowable. {{ the_authors_first_only }} never give the reader any
more information than the characters have, and they never show us the aliens.
They don't even hint at what the Visitors might be like, other than by showing
us the incomprehensible items they left behind. Humans have no better chance
of understanding an Empty or the Golden Sphere than an ant has of
understanding a nuclear reactor. Red's daughter, the Monkey, fits this theme
too, becoming more and more alien as she grows older and losing the ability to
understand her parents at all.

{{ the_authors }} make the Zone feel dangerous and oppressive without
overdoing it. We only see the inside of the Zone twice: once at the very
start, when Red takes Dr. Kirill Panov to collect a full Empty, and again at
the end, when Red sacrifices Arthur to the grinder to make a wish at the
Golden Sphere. But the Zone looms over the entire novel, always feeling like
it's about to erupt from the pages.

{{ this_book }} pays homage to {{ wellss }} {{ war_of_the_worlds }} in more
than just being a first-contact story. {{ wellss }} Martians travel to Earth
using a giant cannon. Dr. Pillman describes the Visitors' arrival by saying,
"all six Visit Zones are positioned on the surface of the planet like bullet
holes made by a gun located somewhere between Earth and Deneb." Like {{ wellss
}} Martians, the Visitors landed in several places across the planet.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of others. The institute trying to contain and
study the Zone's artifacts recalls the SCP Foundation from {{ qntms }} {{
antimemetics }}. The rundown town with supernatural elements is like Revachol
in {{ disco_elysium }}. Alien trash appearing on Earth and being studied or
weaponized is the same theme as {{ bankss }} {{ cleaning }} from {{ art }}.
Red, the red-headed, freckled, anti-authority figure, reminded me of Rorschach
in {{ moore }} and {{ gibbonss }} {{ watchmen }}.

I really enjoyed {{ this_book }}, and I'll definitely be reading more of {{
the_authors_possessive }} work. Their style feels so different from the
American and British sci-fi I'm used to that it provides a nice change of
pace. Next up: {{ bolo11 }}, {{ hyperion }}, and perhaps {{ lost }}.
