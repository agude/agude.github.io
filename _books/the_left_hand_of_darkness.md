Genly Ai is a human envoy sent from the Ekumen to the world of Winter to bring
the Gethenian people into galactic society. The Gethenians are human but
modified to be hermaphroditic, a characteristic that shapes their entire
civilization. The story broken in three distinct parts:

- In the first part, Genly lives in Karhide where he---under the advisement of
  the vizier Estraven---tries to convince the King to join the Ekumen. This
  leads to Estraven being banished as a traitor and Genly traveling to Orgoreyn.

- The second part follows Genly in Orgoreyn, a nation modeled after the
  Soviet Union. While initially impressed by their organization, he soon
  discovers their darker side when he's detained by the secret police and
  sent to a gulag.

- The third part chronicles Estraven's rescue of Genly and their desperate
  escape across a glacier back to Karhide.

The narrative is primarily from Genly's perspective, interwoven with Gethenian
myths, reports from earlier observers of Winter, and excerpts from Estraven's
journal. Genly's point of view is that of a male in a society with far
different gender norms. He constantly forces his gender binary onto people,
describing them as masculine or feminine despite their androgyny. The
inclusion of Estraven's journal is a wonderful way to flip this point of view,
because often it will describe the same scenes and conversations but from a
Gethenian point of view.

{{ this_book }} is my first experience with {{ the_authors }} work, and it
defied my expectations. Having just finished from reading {{ banks }} {{
the_culture_series }}, I was misled by Genly's role as Envoy and his
interactions with political leaders into thinking the main conflict would
center on the territorial dispute between Karhide and Orgoreyn over a fertile
valley. Instead, the book focuses on exploring the civilizations through
Genly's eyes as he struggles with his own gendered, sometimes misogynistic
viewpoint while trying to understand an androgynous people.

The book reminds me of {{ algernon }}: both are acclaimed, award-winning
novels that depend heavily on readers forming emotional connections with the
characters and feeling the impact of their struggles. Both use their stories
as lenses to examine aspects of our own world---{{ algernon_short }} explores
the treatment of the mentally handicapped, while {{ this_book }} examines
gender roles. And like {{ algernon_short }}, {{ this_book }} didn't affect me
as deeply as I'd anticipated.

There are also a lot of parallels with {{ clarkes }} {{ childhood }}. Both
books examine first contact with a peaceful, patient "alien". Both weave
together telepathy and mysticism with scientific elements. And both explore
how societies respond to major, fundamental changes: {{ the_authors }} work
looks at how a civilization reacts to moving beyond the gender binary, while
{{ clarkes }} examines humanity's evolution into something completely new.

Still, certain scenes left lasting impressions: Genly's transportation
in the truck to the gulag, and his and Estraven's escape across the ice. {{
the_authors }} writing is haunting, sprinkled with insights like:

> It is a terrible thing, this kindness that human beings do not lose.
> Terrible, because when we are finally naked in the dark and cold, it is all
> we have. We who are so rich, so full of strength, we end up with that small
> change. We have nothing else to give.

I'll likely explore more of {{ the_authors }} books in the future, now that I
have a better idea of what to expect.
