Genly Ai is a man, sent from the Ekumen to the world of Winter to try to bring
the Gethenian people into galactic society. The Gethenians are human, but
modified to be hermaphroditic, a fact that shapes their entire society. The
story is broken roughly into three parts:

- In the first part Genly is living in Karhide, where he---under the advisement
of the vizier Estraven---tries to convince the King to join the Ekumen. This
action leads to Estraven being banished as a traitor, and Genly traveling to
Orgoreyn.

- The second part follows Genly as he travels to and begins living in
Orgoreyn, a country

The
story is told from Genly's point of view, with a few interspersed Gethian
myths, some reports from the people who proceeded Genly on Winter, and exerts
from Estraven's journal.

{{ this_book }} is my first read of {{ the_authors }} books, and I wasn't sure
what to expect. Having just read a bunch of {{ banks }} {{ the_culture_series
}}, I was misled by Genly's position as the Envoy to the world of Winter and
his conversations with kings and leaders into thinking that the main conflict
would be between the two societies---the Karhide and the Orgoreyn---over a
fertile valley. But instead the book is primarily a tour of the civilization
from the point of view of Genly, who projects his own gendered, somewhat
misogynistic views onto the androgynous people.


his conversations with kings and leaders, and the nascent
boarder dispute into thinking the story would primarily deal with


, exploring themes of gender, politics, and human
connection through his relationship with the enigmatic Gethenian, Estraven.
