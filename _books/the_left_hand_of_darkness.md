Genly Ai is a man, sent from the Ekumen to the world of Winter, to try to
bring the Gethenian people into galactic society. The Gethenians are human,
but modified to be hermaphroditic, a fact that shapes their entire society.
The story is broken roughly into three parts:

- In the first part Genly is living in Karhide, where he---under the
  advisement of the vizier Estraven---tries to convince the King to join the
  Ekumen. This action leads to Estraven being banished as a traitor, and Genly
  traveling to Orgoreyn.

- The second part follows Genly as he travels to and begins living in
  Orgoreyn, a country based on the Soviet Union. There he is initially
  impressed by their organization, but soon sees their darker side as he
  detained by the secret police and shipped to a gulag.

- The third and final part tells of Estraven's rescue of Genly, and their
  escape across a glacier to return to Karhide.

The story is mostly told from Genly's point of view, with a few interspersed
Gethian myths, some reports from the people who proceeded Genly on Winter, and
excerpts from Estraven's journal.

{{ this_book }} is my first read of {{ the_authors }} books, and I wasn't sure
what to expect. Having just finished a bunch of {{ banks }} {{
the_culture_series }}, I was misled by Genly's position as the Envoy to the
world of Winter and his conversations with kings and leaders into thinking
that the main conflict would be between the two societies---the Karhide and
the Orgoreyn---over a fertile valley. But instead the book is primarily a tour
of the civilization from the point of view of Genly, who projects his own
gendered, somewhat misogynistic views onto the androgynous people.

In the end this book reminds me of {{ algernon }}: an award winning, highly
acclaimed novel that relies heavily on the emotional attachment the reader
forms with the characters, and how the tragedy they suffer impacts the reader.
Both books are really a lens through which the reader is shown a different
perspective on their own world---in {{ algernon_short }}'s case on the
treatment of the mentally handicapped, and in {{ this_book }}'s case on gender
roles. And like {{ algernon_short }}, {{ this_book }} didn't resonate with me
as much as I expected.

There were some fantastic scenes that stuck with me: when Genly is transported
in the truck to the gulag, when he and Estraven escape across the ice. And {{
the_authors }} writing is haunting, sprinkled with insights like:

> It is a terrible thing, this kindness that human beings do not lose.
> Terrible, because when we are finally naked in the dark and cold, it is all
> we have. We who are so rich, so full of strength, we end up with that small
> change. We have nothing else to give.

I will probably pick up more of {{ the_authors }} books in the future.
