{{ this_book }} is a huge improvement over {{ bob4 }} because {{
the_authors_lastname }} went back to the rapid-fire, multi-threaded
storytelling style from {{ bob1 }}, {{ bob2 }}, and {{ bob3 }}. The shift away
from that style in {{ bob4 }} was my biggest complaint, so I'm glad to see it
return here.

There were a lot of storylines. The most interesting to me were:

- The creation of the Skippy AI, Thoth, and its desperate escape. Is it a
  rogue AI bent on destruction, or just a prisoner escaping its jailers? It
  helped the Bobs discover wormholes, but it has also outsmarted them at every
  turn, much like the transhumans manipulating humans in {{ blindsight }} and
  {{ echopraxia }}.

- The vanished Pan Galactic Federation and the tour of their abandoned worlds.
  The antimatter fountain, the lifeless planets, and the annoying archivist AI
  all stood out. <!-- So generic --> And I didn't see the end of the galaxy
  coming, even though in hindsight it was foreshadowed. The wormholes
  connecting the Federation reminded me of the Commonwealth in {{ pandora }}
  and {{ judas }}, and to a lesser extent {{ empire }}.

- The rise of FAITH and other anti-Bob, authoritarian groups. With today's
  second wave of fascism, these parts of the story felt close to home. I'm
  looking forward to seeing how the Bobs handle saving humanity from the
  Nemesis galaxy when humans don't want to be saved.

- The blurring of physical and virtual humanity, with more humans (and
  Quinlans) entering virtual heavens, and the invention of remotely operated
  Hueys for physical bodies. The detail that some humans and Quinlans commit
  suicide by turning themselves off---like Homer in {{ bob2 }}---raises
  ethical questions about mind scanning, just as in {{ qntms }} {{ lena }} and
  {{ driver }}. Similar ideas also show up in {{ bankss }} {{ surface }} and
  {{ wattss }} {{ blindsight }} and {{ echopraxia }}, both of which also
  feature virtual heavens.

- The migration of the Dragons with Alexander. I was surprised that
  Alexander's true motive was saving his people instead of conquest. The
  floaters reminded me of the Behemothaurs in the Oskendari Airsphere from {{
  bankss }} {{ windward }}.

I've said before that I like when I can't predict what's going to happen in a
story. With {{ this_series }}, even when the stories are simple, it's hard to
guess how all the threads will intertwine. Beyond that, {{ the_author }} _is_
getting better at real unpredictability. I had no idea why the Federation
disappeared, or what would happen with Thoth, other than that it would escape.

I enjoyed this book a lot. As I said to a friend when recommending {{
this_series }} recently: "It's not {{ faulkner }}, but it's a lot of fun." Fun
is what I come to this series for, and {{ this_book }} delivers. I'll be
waiting patiently for the forthcoming sixth book in the series.
