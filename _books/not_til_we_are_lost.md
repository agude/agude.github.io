{{ this_book }} is a huge improvement over {{ bob4 }} because {{
the_authors_lastname }} went back to the rapid-fire, multiple  interweaving
storyline style he originated in {{ bob1 }}, {{ bob2 }}, and {{ bob3 }}. The
change in style was my biggest complaint about the last book, so it is good to
be back.

There were a lot of storylines, most interesting to me were:

- The creation of the Skippy AI, Thoth, and it's desperate escape. Is it a
  rogue AI bent on destruction, or just a prisoner escaping it's jailers? It
  helped the Bobs discover wormholes, but it has also outsmarted them at every
  turn like the transhumans manipulating the humans in {{ blindsight }} and {{
  echopraxia }}.

- The vanished Pan Galactic Federation and the tour of their worlds. It was
  great to see fantastic natural events like the antimatter fountain, the
  various abandoned worlds, and the annoying archivist AI. And I didn't see
  the end of the galaxy coming, even though in hindsight it was foreshadowed.
  The wormholes reminded me of the Commonwealth in {{ pandora }} and {{ judas
  }}, and to a lesser extent {{ empire }}.

- The rise of FAITH and other anti-Bob, authoritarian parties. With the
  modern, second rise of fascism these parts of the story feel much closer to
  home. I'm looking forward to seeing how the Bobs handle saving the humans
  from the Nemesis galaxy when they don't want to be saved.

- The blurring between physical and virtual humanity, with the introduction of
  more humans, and Quinlans, into virtual heavens, and the invention of remotely
  operated Hueys for humans. The introduction of the fact that some humans and
  Quinlans turn commit suicide by turning themselves off, just like Homer in
  {{ bob2 }}, makes us think about the ethical implications of mind scanning,
  similarly {{ qntms }} {{ lena }} and {{ driver }}. Similar ideas were
  explored in {{ bankss }} {{ surface }} and {{ wattss }} {{ blindsight }} and
  {{ echopraxia }}, both of which have virtual heavens.

- The migration of the Dragons, with Alexander. I was surprised Alexander's
  motive was to save his people rather than conquer. The floaters reminded me
  of the Behemothaur in the Oskendari Airsphere	from {{ bankss }} {{ windward
  }}.

I've said before that I value not being able to predict the storyline before
it happens, but that {{ this_series }} doesn't bother me even though the
stories are simple, because it's still hard to predict how all the storylines
will intertwine. But beyond that, {{ the_author }} _is_ getting better at
making things hard to predict. I had no idea why the Federation disappeared,
nor what would happen with Thoth except that it would escape.

I enjoyed this book a lot. As I said to a friend when recommending {{
this_series }} recently: "It's not {{ faulkner }}, but it's a lot of fun". Fun
is what I come to this series for, and {{ this_book }} delivers. I'm waiting
patiently for the forthcoming sixth book in the series.
