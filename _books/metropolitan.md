it draws her into conflict with the world.

{{ this_book }} is an urban fantasy novel set in a city that covers the Earth.
Its structure, mass, and geometric layout generate plasm---an electricity‑like
substance mages need to power their spells. The setting is the far future,
like {{ wolfes }} {{ torturer }}, but unlike {{ wolfes_short }} work, this
world still has modern technology---skyscrapers, subways, computers,
cars---and magic that feels systematic, almost technological.

The story follows Aiah, her family, and her people, who are refugees from
their destroyed metropolis. They're people of color, living as second-class
citizens in a white-run city, preyed upon by both the government and organized
crime. Aiah has climbed precariously into the middle class, a position that
earns her resentment from society for rising too far, and from her family for
leaving them behind. It feels like a tale set in an immigrant neighborhood in
1980s Brooklyn---until you remember Aiah is a mage. That a ten‑story‑tall
flaming woman leveled Wall Street. That ghosts haunt the power lines. That a
glowing shield encases Earth, imprisoning all humanity.

The best thing about {{ this_book }} is the subtle world‑building scattered
throughout, much like {{ jacksons }} {{ tainted }}. The plot builds steadily:
first Aiah figures out how to profit from an illegal plasm well while hiding
it from the authorities, then she's swept into a revolution that could reshape
the world order.

The characters are the weakest part, though still well written. Aiah makes
selfish choices---true to her character---but that kept me from fully enjoying
reading about her. The supporting cast is large; a few feel clichéd, but most
are engaging and memorable. The most exciting character is Taikoen, the hanged
man. Once human, now a plasm ghost transformed by overexposure, he's the
terrible secret behind the revolution's success.

One of the central themes of the book is freedom and its cost. Aiah feels
stuck in her dead-end job that doesn't quite pay the bills, and she is willing
to steal plasm to escape. Constantine rebels against the oppressive
governments of the city. Taikoen is bound to his ghost-form; he possesses and
kills others to temporarily be human again. Humanity itself is trapped on
Earth by the shield. There is a motif of flight---especially the peregrine
falcon---that reinforces the theme of freedom.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of several other works:

- The in‑world ads that separate sections are similar to the in-world
  narrative breaks in {{ brunners }} {{ stand_on_zanzibar }}.

- The pneumatic tube messaging system at Aiah's workplace is like the
  infofiches in {{ martines }} {{ empire }}.

- The dolphins fighting for freedom are reminiscent of those in {{ brins }} {{
  startide }}, even if the ones in this book are likely modified humans.

- The blend of magic, technology, and revolution echoes <cite
  class="video-game-title">Final Fantasy VI</cite> and <cite
  class="video-game-title">Final Fantasy VII</cite>. Mako is similar to plasm,
  although Mako's extraction destroys the planet while plasm's is more benign.

- The ghostly voices in the background of Aiah's calls are like the
  entroponetic interference on the intercom in {{ disco }}.

- The final battle, where mages and attack helicopters share the battlefield,
  reminded me of a <cite class="table-top-game-title">Shadowrun</cite>
  session.

{{ the_author }} leaves many questions unanswered: What is the shield, and why
was it erected? How will Aiah and Constantine control Taikoen? Will the
revolution's ideals be corrupted as they turn towards governing? I hope I find
out in {{ city }}.
