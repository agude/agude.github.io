<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>, is the forth and final book
in the <span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It tells the
story of the Patternist brothers Teray and Coransee as they fight to become
the new Patternmaster.

The setting and style of {{ this_book }} is different from the other three
books in the series. {{ p1 }} reads as historical fiction with some magical
elements; {{ p2 }} and {{ p3 }} are more contemporary fiction with some science
fiction elements; {{ this_book }} reads as almost pure fantasy. The Earth has
changed so much it might as well be a different planet. The Patternist society
is feudal with magic overlaid on top. The king is dying and his sons fight for
control.

This genre shift made the book much easier to read, and for the first time in
the series I found myself excited to keep reading instead of feeling like I
was trudging through the pages. Teray, Coransee, and their various followers
are nowhere near as menacing or well constructed as Doro and Anyanwu were in
{{ p1 }}, but the plot made up for it. Having read about the very different
Patternist setting I can see why {{ p2 }} and {{ p3 }} were written---the
world is excitingly different and if I didn't know from the previous books I'd
want to understand how it got to be that way. But it didn't change my opinion
of those books; I don't think they were compelling stories.

Like the other books in the series, {{ this_book }} deals with slavery and the
abuse that comes from it. The entire civilization is hierarchical, with the
most powerful Patternists controlling those below them. Children and people
not part of a house are fair game to abuse and enslave. Might makes right.

Weirdly enough, {{ this_book }} reminds me of the anime <cite
class="tv-show-title">Attack On Titan</cite>. Both civilzation---the
Patternists and the Eldians---based on genetic superpowers that they use to
oppress humans. Both are under siege by human-monsters---the Clayarks and the
Titans. Both works deal with themes of hierachy and power. I also couldn't
help but picture the quadrupedal Clayarks as the Cart Titan.

{{ this_book }} was a fun way to finish a very uneven series. I'm glad I made
it through, but I wish the middle books were better.
