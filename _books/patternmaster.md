<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>, is the fourth and final
book in the <span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It
follows the Patternist brothers, Teray and Coransee, as they fight each other
to become the new Patternmaster.

The setting and style of {{ this_book }} are completely different from the
other three books in the series. {{ p1 }} reads like historical fiction with
magical elements, while {{ p2 }} and {{ p3 }} feel more like contemporary
fiction with some sci-fi twists. {{ this_book }}, is almost pure fantasy: the
Earth has changed so much it might as well be an entirely different planet;
the Patternist society is feudal, with magic overlaid on top; the king is
dying, and his sons are fighting for control.

This genre shift made the book much easier to read. For the first time in the
series, I was actually excited to keep going instead of feeling like I was
trudging through the pages. Teray, Coransee, and their followers aren't as
menacing or well-developed as Doro and Anyanwu were in {{ p1 }}, but the plot
made up for it. After seeing how different the Patternist world is, I
understand why {{ p2 }} and {{ p3 }} were written---the setting is excitingly
strange, and if I hadn't read the earlier books, I'd be curious about how
things got this way. But it didn't change my opinion of those books---I still
don't think they were compelling stories.

Like the rest of the series, {{ this_book }} deals with slavery and the abuse
that comes with it. The entire civilization is built on hierarchy, with the
most powerful Patternists controlling those beneath them. Children and those
outside the houses are fair game for abuse and enslavement. Might makes right.

Weirdly enough, {{ this_book }} reminds me of the anime <cite
class="tv-show-title">Attack on Titan</cite>. Both civilizations---the
Patternists and the Eldians---are built around genetic superpowers that they
use to oppress others. Both are under siege by human-monsters---the Clayarks
and the Titans. Both explore themes of hierarchy and power. I also couldn't
help but picture the quadrupedal Clayarks as the Cart Titan.

{{ this_book }} was a fun way to finish a very uneven series. I'm glad I made
it through, but I wish the middle books had been better. I am looking forward
to reading {{ butlers }} masterpiece, {{ pots }}, at some point in the future.
