The story takes place on the Masaq' Orbital as the light from the last battle
of the Idiran--Culture war reaches the habitat, prompting its inhabitants to
reflect on the conflict. The main characters are:

- Mahrai Ziller, a cat-like Chelgrian composer living in self-imposed exile
  from his people, commissioned to write a symphony commemorating the war's end.

- Major Quilan, a Chelgrian operative supposedly visiting Masaq' to persuade
  Ziller to return home, but actually on a mission of revenge.

- Admiral Huyler, a preserved mind sharing Quilan's body as a copilot.

- Masaq' Hub, the Culture Mind managing the Orbital, formerly a warship that
  committed atrocities during the war.

- Uagen Zlepe, a Culture academic studying gigantic beings far from the
  Orbital who becomes entangled in Quilan's plot.

The Chelgrians plan to destroy Masaq' Hub and kill billions in revenge for the
Chelgrian civil war, which the Culture accidentally triggered while trying to
reform the Chelgrians' brutal caste system.

### {{ c1_nolink }}

{{ this_book }} is a sequel to {{ c1 }}, but in many ways it feels more like a
rewrite. Both books share core themes, especially the idea that individuals rarely
influence larger events. In {{ c1 }}, this plays out through the death of
almost every character in a mission to capture or recover a Mind that proves
meaningless to the war effort. In {{ this_book }}, it's shown through Zlepe's
seemingly urgent mission to warn of Quilan's genocidal plot---a plot that was
doomed from the start. In both cases, the characters' actions have no impact
on the wider galaxy.

Both books examine the Culture through their enemies' eyes---enemies who lost
wars that the Culture initiated---and explore the moral ambiguities of the
Culture's military interventions to reshape other societies.

### {{ the_wasteland_nolink }}

The connection between these books is reinforced by their titles: both {{
this_book }} and {{ c1 }} are drawn from {{ elliots }} {{ the_wasteland }}. {{
this_book }} weaves the poem's imagery throughout: Masaq' Hub literally
"_turn[s] the wheel and look[s] to windward_"; Zlepe's fate mirrors that of
Phlebas, who died during a voyage and is trapped forever in a whirlpool, just
as Zlepe dies in space with his body doomed to orbit the galaxy; and the eDust
assassin embodies "_fear in a handful of dust_."

{{ this_book }} shares {{ the_wasteland }}'s focus on death and rebirth. These
themes are hammered home[^lampshade] through parallel stories: Ibm Dolince
choosing to let his physical body die and upload his mind, paired with Nisil
Tchasole's rebirth into a new body. The Chelgrians back up their minds for
heaven or rebirth, as we see with Admiral Huyler, while the Culture does it to
preserve their citizens, which are stored in the Hub until rebirth. Quilan's
wife's total death---with no backup for rebirth---drives his suicidal mission.
The Hub itself has died twice, been restored from backup once, and transferred
to its current body on Masaq'. In the end, both the Hub and Quilan choose
complete erasure---true death with no chance of rebirth.

    > The pairing of this [Misil Tchasole's] rebirth with Ibm Dolince's death
    > was supposed to take some of the sadness out of the man's departure, but
    > Ziller found the very neatness of the pairing trite and contrived.

### Thoughts

At the end of {{ this_book }} we learn that the stakes we thought were in play
never were. While this might put some off, but I loved the book as a tour of a
Culture Orbital, and for the deep characters: Quilan and the Hub are great
portrayals of veterans suffering from PTSD.[^gulf_war]

[^gulf_war]: The book is dedicated "For the Gulf War Veterans".

I particularly appreciated Zlepe's storyline as a red herring---his desperate
rush to warn the Culture of the attack, only to die in the attempt and reveal
that the Culture knew all along. It is a more effective demonstration of
individual insignificance than {{ c1 }}, particularly because of how it
subverts the traditional "hero saves the day" narrative.

The dialogue between Ziller and the Hub about artistic
creation---specifically, why Ziller should compose at all when any Culture
Mind could perfectly replicate and improve upon his style---resonates strongly
with current debates about [AI's role in art][art].

{{ this_book }} gives us a more personal look into how Minds operate than {{
c5 }}, while still showing glimpses of the kind of Mind-vs-Mind plotting we
saw there. We've seen the Culture's interventions work out before---the
careful scheming in {{ c2 }}, the covert ops in {{ c3 }}, and the subtle
manipulation in {{ c6 }}---but here we see what happens when their
calculations fail, leading to catastrophe.

{{ this_book }} reminds me of several recent reads: the memory backups and
artificial afterlife echo both the Commonwealth humans in {{ pandora }} and the
virtual heaven in {{ blindsight }}. Masaq' Orbital's Great River seems to have
influenced {{ river }}. The Culture Minds' practice of unauthorized brain
scans to prevent deaths parallels the central premise of {{ valuable }}'s
title story.

{{ this_book }} is another great entry in the {{ this_series }}. I'm looking
forward to seeing how {{ c8 }}'s story, about another Culture intervention,
compares.
