The story takes place mostly on the Masaq' Orbital as the light from the last
battle of the Idiran--Culture war reaches the habitat and the people reflect
on the conflict. The primary characters are:

- The composer Mahrai Ziller, a cat-like Chelgrian in self-imposed exile
  from his people, hired to compose a symphony in commemorating the end of the
  war.
- Major Quilan, a Chelgrian operative nominally visiting Masaq' to convince
  Ziller to return to his home world, but is really on a mission of revenge.
- Admiral Huyler, an preserved mind who rides copilot in Quilan's body.
- Masaq' Hub, the Culture Mind who tends the Orbital, and was once a warship
  that committed atrocities.
- Uagen Zlepe, a Culture academic who is studying gigantic beings far from the
  Orbital, but gets sucked into Quilan's plot.

The Chelgrians are plotting to destrog Masaq' Hub and kill billions in revenge
for the Chelgrian civil war the Culture accidentally started when trying to
reform the Chelgrian's brutal caste system.

## {{ c1_nolink }}

{{ this_book }} is a sequel to {{ c1 }}, but in many respects I actually think
it is a rewrite. Both books share common themes, foremost among them that
people are small and they mostly don't make a difference in larger events. In
{{ c1 }} this is demonstrated by all the death and destruction in an effort to
capture a mind that has no importance to the greater war effort. In {{
this_book }} it is exemplified by Zlepe's seeming urgent mission to warn the
Culture of the genocidal plot, and the plots complete failure from the very
moment it was conceived. In both books, nothing the characters do changes the
wider galaxy at all.

Both books also looks at the Culture from the point of view of their
enemies---enemies who are on the losing end of a war the Culture started---and
explores the moral ambiguities of the Culture's military intervention in an
attempt to make things better.

## {{ the_wasteland_nolink }}

The connection between the books is reinforced by their names: {{ this_book }}
and {{ c1 }} are both from {{ elliots }} poem {{ the_wasteland }}. {{
this_book }} draws heavily from the poem for its characters as well: Masaq'
Hub literally _"turn[s] the wheel and look[s] to windward"_; Uagen Zlepe's
fate mirrors that of Phlebas in the poem, who died on a voyage and is trapped
in the whirlpool of the galaxy; the eDust assassin is _"[...]fear in a handful
of dust."_

{{ this_book }} and {{  the_wasteland }} share as focus on death and rebirth.
The themes are hammered home[^lampshade] with the pairing of Ibm Dolince's
death---where he decides to let his physical body die and upload his
mind---and Nisil Tchasole's rebirth---where her mind is loaded into a new
body. Chelgrians backup their minds so they can be sent to heaven or reborn
into a new body. Admiral Huyler is one such example. Quilan is driven on his
suicidal mission by the death total death of his wife, preventing rebirth. The
Hub has died, been restored from backup, died again, and was transfered to its
current body on Masaq'. Both the Hub and Quilan choose to commit suicide and
completely erase themselves from the universe.

    > The pairing of this [Misil Tchasole's] rebirth with Ibm Dolince's death
    > was supposed to take some of the sadness out of the man's departure, but
    > Ziller found the very neatness of the pairing trite and contrived.

## Thoughts

Although nothing really happens in {{ this_book }}, I loved it as a tour of a
Culture Orbital, and for the deep characters.

The memory backups in case of death (and the Culture Citizen's love for
extreme, deadly sports because of it) remind me of the Commonwealth humans in
{{ pandora }}. The fact that the sublimed Chelgrian created their own
literally heaven is reminiscent of the virtual heaven in {{ blindsight }}.
Masaq' Orbital's Great River the circles the entire mega-structure probably
influenced {{ river }}.
