<span class="book-title">The Causal Angel</span> is the last book in the Jean
le Flambeur trilogy. In it we finally discover what le Flambeur was hired to
steal: the Kaminari Jewel with the power to change reality.

We learn that the Pellegrini extracted two people from the dilemma prison: Le
Flamebeur and a corrupted version of him known as the All-Defector that can
predict anyone's action and counter it. The Pellegrini intended to use the
All-Defector as a backup plan if le Flambeur failed, but instead it betrays
her. The All-Defector begins taking over the entire Sobornost and leads them
into a war against the Zoku in order to capture the Kaminari Jewel and use it
to create a new universe before some other civilization is able to do it
first: the ultimate game-theory defection.

Throughout the book layers and layers of scheming are revealed:

- Le Flambeur sent himself to the dilemma prison in order to evolve a new
  personality that the Kaminari Jewel would accept.
- The All-Defector (the primary antagonist of the series) sets up Jean to
  disrupt the Zoku so the Sobornost that he controls can take over the solar
  system.
- Barbicane, of the Zoku, set up Jean to disrupt the Zoku's quantum
  entanglement so he could destroy the Kaminari Jewel.

The novel fleshes the characters out more, and for the first time I actually
care bout Mieli, but they're still the weakest part of the series. But the
book does a good job of wrapping up storylines and the ending is satisfying.

While I enjoyed {% include book_link.html title="The Fractal Prince" %}
slightly more, <span class="book-title">The Causal Angel</span> was a good
ending to a good series.
