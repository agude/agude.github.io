<span class="book-title">The Causal Angel</span> is the last book in the Jean
le Flambeur trilogy. We finally learn le Flambeur was hired to steal the
Kaminari Jewel, a Zoku gem with the power to alter reality.

We discover that the Pellegrini extracted two people from the prison: Le
Flamebeur and his corrupted copy, the All-Defector, who can predict and
counter anyone's actions. The Pellegrini intended to use the All-Defector as a
backup plan if le Flambeur failed, but it betrays her. The All-Defector starts
taking over the Sobornost and leads them into war against the Zoku to capture
the Jewel. It wants to create a new universe before anyone else can---the
ultimate defection.

Layers of scheming are revealed:

- Le Flambeur sent himself to prison to evolve a new personality the Jewel
  would accept.
- The All-Defector sets up Jean to disrupt the Zoku so the Sobornost he
  controls can take over.
- Barbicane set up Jean to disrupt the Zoku's quantum entanglement, allowing
  him to attempt to destroy the Kaminari Jewel.

The book fleshes out the characters more, and for the first time I actually
care bout Mieli, but they're still the weakest part of the series. However,
the book does a good job of wrapping up storylines and the ending is
satisfying.

While I enjoyed {% include book_link.html title="The Fractal Prince" %}
slightly more, <span class="book-title">The Causal Angel</span> was a good
ending to a good trilogy.
