<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the last book in the <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> trilogy. We finally learn le
Flambeur was hired to steal the Kaminari Jewel, a Zoku gem with the power to
alter reality.

We discover that the Pellegrini extracted two people from the prison: Le
Flambeur and his corrupted copy, the All-Defector, who can predict and counter
anyone's actions. The Pellegrini intended to use the All-Defector as a backup
plan if le Flambeur failed, but it betrays her. The All-Defector starts taking
over the Sobornost and leads them into war against the Zoku to capture the
Jewel. It wants to create a new universe before anyone else can---the ultimate
defection.

Layers of scheming are revealed:

- Le Flambeur sent himself to prison to evolve a new personality the Jewel
  would accept.

- The All-Defector sets up Jean to disrupt the Zoku so the Sobornost he
  controls can take over.

- Barbicane set up Jean to disrupt the Zoku's quantum entanglement, allowing
  him to attempt to destroy the Kaminari Jewel.

The book fleshes out the characters more, and for the first time I actually
care about Mieli, but they're still the weakest part of the series. However,
the book does a good job of wrapping up storylines and the ending is
satisfying.

While I enjoyed {{ fractal_prince }} slightly more, {{ this_book }} was an ok
ending to an ok trilogy.
