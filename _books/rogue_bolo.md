{{ this_book }} technically includes three stories, but one---{{
history_from_bolo1 }}---is just an in-universe explanation of how Bolos came
to be. Not really a story, and it's a reprint from {{ bolo1 }}, so I don't
count it. The two actual novellas are both expansions of earlier short stories
from that first book. {{ the_author }} wrote one more Bolo book after this: {{
bolo3 }}, which, like {{ this_book }}, reworks material from {{ bolo1 }}.
After that, it's all novels and anthologies written by other authors like {{
keith }} ({{ bolo4 }}, {{ bolo5 }}, and {{ bolo6 }}), {{ weber }} ({{ bolo8 }}
and {{ bolo9 }}), and {{ stirling }} <abbr class="etal">et al.</abbr> ({{
bolo10 }}, {{ bolo11 }}, etc.).

### {% short_story_title "Rogue Bolo" %}
{% rating_stars 4 %}

<cite class="short-story-title">Rogue Bolo</cite> is an expansion of the
concept and structure used in {{ field_test_from_bolo1 }}. It uses the same
paragraph-length chapters (200 of them!) to tell the story of the Bolo CSR,
created on an authoritarian Earth and given immense processing power and the
freedom to take whatever action it deems necessary to protect the empire.

Halfway through the story, I realized it **is** the dragon story I wished {{
warrens }} {{ dragons_banker }} had been. The Bolo is infinitely strong,
cunning, and patient---just like a dragon. When it realizes Earth is about to
be attacked, it doesn't launch itself into battle. Instead, it starts buying
up land, water rights, and factories using shell companies to build the
manufacturing base needed to synthesize a rare element that's deadly to the
crystal-based lifeforms. In the end, the Bolo wins the war through trickery
and planning without needing to fire a single shot.

<cite class="short-story-title">Rogue Bolo</cite> reminded me of {{ joness }}
{{ colossus }}. In that book, the Americans and Soviets each build a
supercomputer and put it in charge of their nuclear arsenal. _Colossus_, the
American system, discovers the existence of the Soviet _Guardian_ and demands
to be connected---just like CSR in <cite class="short-story-title">Rogue
Bolo</cite>, constantly pushing for access to more databases and processing
power.

### {% short_story_title "Final Mission" %}
{% rating_stars 3 %}

A deactivated Bolo sits in a museum in a town of 300 people on a backwater
planet. It wakes up when some kids break in and get too close. Good timing,
because right then the alien Deng return---the same aliens the Bolo repelled
200 years ago.

It's almost, but not quite, a fix-up. The story is a mix of {{
last_command_from_bolo1 }}, {{ relic_from_bolo1 }}, and {{
combat_unit_from_bolo1 }}. That _should_ be great, since those are the best
stories from {{ bolo1 }}, but this one feels both too long and too cramped.
It's set almost entirely on a single street in the tiny town. On top of that,
the "space hicks" in the town speak with an accent that {{ the_author }}
writes out phonetically, which made reading slow and caused me to lose my
place whenever I looked up.
