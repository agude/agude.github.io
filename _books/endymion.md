<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is the third book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span>. It follows a new cast of
characters---Aenea, Raul, and Bettik---as they flee the oppressive forces of
the Pax via a raft on the River Tethys. Set centuries after the earlier books,
the story reveals a galaxy reshaped by the Church and its dark covenant of
immortality.

{{ the_authors_lastname_possessive }} {{ hyperion }} and {{ fall_hyperion }}
model their plots and themes on {{ keatss }} {{ hyperion_keats }} and {{
fall_keats }}. {{ this_book }} follows suit, taking its inspiration from {{
keatss_lastname }} {{ endymion_keats_same_name }}. It is the story of the
mortal shepherd Endymion, who falls in love with the moon goddess Cynthia.
This relationship shapes both works.

### Themes

One of the main themes of {{ keatss_lastname_endymion }} is the pairing of the
mortal and the immortal, the earthly and the divine, and we see those same
pairings in {{ the_authors_lastname_possessive }} {{ this_book }} as well.
Aenea is a messianic figure, a mix of humanity and the divine. The coming
Teilhardian human god, created from humanity evolving to godhood, is the same.
By contrast, the Pax has given up on the divine and turned to technology,
granting immortality through the cruciform parasite instead of true spiritual
immortality. Just as in {{ hyperion }} and {{ fall_hyperion }}, things must
"die into life", but the Pax, like the Hegemony before it, has refused death
and chosen stagnation.

The story in {{ this_book }} follows the structure of Endymion's journey in
the {{ endymion_keats }}, with Raul visiting the underworld (the ice cave of
Sol Draconi Septem) and the ocean floor (Mare Infinitus), and meeting
[Glaucus][glaucus]. It is influenced by other literature as well. The raft
voyage itself comes from {{ twains }} {{ huck_finn }}, with the formerly
enslaved android Bettik standing in as a Jim figure. {{ the_authors_lastname
}}, as he has done throughout the series, also likens his characters to those
from {{ baums_lastname }} {{ wizard_of_oz }}.

### Story

There was a lot I enjoyed in {{ this_book }}. The nominal antagonist, Federico
de Soya, is sympathetic even as he works against the heroes. His slow
realization that the Pax isn't the salvation of humanity he thought it was is
haunting. The pacing, once the real antagonist---Rhadamanth Nemes---is
revealed, is excellent, and I couldn't stop turning the pages. The additional
worldbuilding, showing how the universe has changed in 300 years, is also
really interesting, especially how humanity reacts to true resurrection and
the horrifying technology it enables. The freed android Bettik is another
great character: searching for his family, unwaveringly loyal and competent,
and unfortunately underutilized.

But for all that, this book is good, not great. The pacing is too slow
overall: Nemes isn't even introduced until the last quarter. Raul and Aenea
are both annoying---Raul because he spends most of the narrative passive, and
then screws things up when he finally acts; Aenea because she is supposed to
be a mix of an immature twelve-year-old and an all-knowing messiah, but
instead comes off as flipping back and forth between the two. Further, she
keeps talking about how she and Raul will someday be lovers, which is
uncomfortable given how young she is, and so {{ the_authors_lastname }} has to
keep throwing in awkward narrator notes reminding us that Raul is not a
pedophile and does not find her attractive. At the same time, {{
the_authors_lastname }} makes winking allusions to {{ nabokov }} and {{ lolita
}}.

### Literary References

{{ the_authors_lastname }} always includes a lot of references to literature
and pop culture in his {{ series_link }}, and this book is no exception. Some
of these influences are structural. The raft voyage, as mentioned, is like
Huck and Jim's trip down the Mississippi in {{ huck_finn }}. Raul as narrator,
writing the story of his and Aenea's lives with authorial interjections, is
like Severian writing his story in {{ wolfes_lastname }} {{ botns }}. Nemes's
use of monofilament wire to slice the raft in half is a direct reference to a
trap used in {{ brunners_lastname }} {{ stand_on_zanzibar }}, and later reused
in {{ lius_lastname }} {{ three_body }}. Nemes herself is also clearly modeled
on the T-1000 from {{ terminator_2 }}: a chrome, shapeshifting, time-traveling
assassin sent by a machine intelligence to kill a messianic child, and
defeated only after being sunk into molten rock when the previous
assassin-turned-bodyguard, the Shrike, fails to stop her in single combat.

Beyond those major influences, there are also smaller moments that reminded me
of other works I've read. The Pax is similar to Gilead from {{
atwoods_lastname }} {{ handmaids_tale }}. Its ban on AI is like the Butlerian
Jihad from {{ herberts_lastname }} {{ dune }}. The Swiss Guard in power armor
acts like the Mobile Infantry in {{ heinleins_lastname }} {{ starship_troopers
}}. The Schrödinger's Cat Box execution method reminded me of the unorthodox
execution used on Horza in {{ bankss_lastname }} {{ consider_phlebas }}. I
loved that androids have "Asimotivation", modeled after {{ asimovs_lastname }}
Three Laws from {{ i_robot }}. The river journey felt like Ozzy's trip with
the Silfen in {{ pandoras_star }} and {{ judas_unchained }}. The A. and M.
honorifics to indicate species were similar to the hand gestures used to
indicate pronouns in {{ alexs_lastname }} {{ mote }}. Being trapped in the ice
cave reminded me of being trapped in the nautilus in {{ langtons_lastname }}
{{ diamond_window }}. The time-travel-based love story is similar to {{
el_mohtar_lastname }} and {{ gladstones_lastname }} {{ time_war }}.

I was tempted to take a break before tackling {{ rise_of_endymion }}, which is
even longer than this book, but instead I decided to pick it up immediately
after finishing. I'm a few chapters into it as I write this review, and I can
already tell it's going to be a struggle. Wish me luck!
