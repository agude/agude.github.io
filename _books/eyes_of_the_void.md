<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is the second book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It takes place
during the second war with the Architects, as Idris and the crew of the
_Vulture God_ discover where the Architects come from.

The plot focuses on the Parthenon Int program, the study of Originator ruins
on a desert planet, and the rescue of Idris from a deathworld where he's able
to explore Unspace with an Originator machine. The tighter focus and smaller
number of locations help {{ this_book }} feel more coherent than {{ fa1 }},
which often felt like we were bouncing from adventure to adventure without a
clear throughline. The characters also have more agency here---saving
themselves instead of relying on _deus ex machina_ like they did in the
previous book.

But the writing is still... workmanlike at best, comparable to {{ tbp }} or {{
suns }}. {{ the_author }} repeats himself over and over and over, maybe
worried the reader won't remember or pick up on things the first time. At one
point I ran into this sentence: "They crossed to the docking field just as the
planet was coming into view, a veiny gas giant like an infected testicle
crawling up the horizon of Hismin's Moon and leaving precious little of the
sky free of its malign radiance." I put the book down and stared into space
for a few minutes thinking, "This series won a Hugo award."

So why do I like this book? The universe's mysteries are keeping me going. I
want to know what the entity in Unspace is, and what its connection to the
Architects might be. I want to see how the war ends. Normally, worldbuilding
alone isn't enough to hold my interest, but in this case, it's doing the job.

This book reminded me of a few other works of fiction:

- The Parthenon garden ships, with their blend of nature and structure, feel
  like Culture ships, especially _Sleeper Service_ from {{ c5 }}.

- The way everything has a price---even getting the police to ignore a
  murder---is like the Corporation Rim in {{ mb4 }}.

- The settlement in the Originator ruins, with its awkward integration into
  alien architecture, recalls Makkathran in {{ void1 }}.

- Tothiat parasite--host naming (Emma and Neth becoming Emmaneth) works a lot
  like how the Trill are named in <cite class="tv-show-title">Deep Space
  9</cite>.

- The planet Matachin is a clear homage to the Matachin Tower in {{ torturer
  }}.

- An intelligence embedded in the fabric of Unspace parallels the mind stored
  in the magnetic field of a black hole in {{ eater }}.

- Ahab, the Naeromathi consumed by vengeance, is obviously modeled on his
  namesake from {{ moby }}.

Once again, I'm going to take a break to read {{ ba1 }}, and probably {{ wow
}} and {{ mb5 }}, before finishing the trilogy with {{ fa3 }}.
