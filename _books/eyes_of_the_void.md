<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is the second book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It takes place
during the second war with the Architects, as Idris and the crew of the
_Vulture God_ discover where the Architects come from.

The plot focuses on the Parthenon Int program, the study of Originator ruins
on a desert planet, and the rescue of Idris from a deathworld where he is able
to explore Unspace with an Originator machine. The tight focus on the plot and
smaller number of locations helps {{ this_book }} feel more coherent than {{
fa1 }}, which often felt like we were bouncing around from adventure to
adventure without clear connection. And the characters have more agency in
this book, saving themselves instead of relying on _deus ex machima_ as in the
previous book.

But the writing is still... workman-like at best, comparable to {{ tbp }} or
{{ suns }}. {{ the_author }} repeats himself over and over and over, perhaps
worried the reader wouldn't remember or pickup on what was said the first
time. At one point I ran into this sentence: "They crossed to the docking
field just as the planet was coming into view, a veiny gas giant like an
infected testicle crawling up the horizon of Hismin's Moon and leaving
previous little of the sky free of its malign radiance." I put the book down
and stared into space for a few minutes thinking "This series won a Hugo
award."

So why do I like this book? The mystery is keeping me going. I want to know
what the entity in Unspace is and what is its connection to the Architects. I
wants to see how the war ends. Normally worldbuilding isn't enough to keep my
going, but in this case it's keeping me interested.

This book reminded me of a few others:

- The Parthenon garden ships, with their mix of nature and buildings, are like
  Culture ships, particularly _Sleeper Service_ from {{ c5 }}.

- Paying for anything---even for the police to look the otherway during a
  murder---was just like the Corporation Rim in {{ mb4 }}.

- Building a city in the Originator Ruins, and having to work around it weird
  architecture, is similar to Makkathran in {{ void1 }}.

- The compound names of the Tothiat parasites and hosts (Emma and Neth become
  Emmaneth) is like how the trill are named in <cite
  class="tv-show-title">Deep Space 9</cite>.

-  The world Matachin is an homage to the Matachin Tower in {{ torturer }}.

- The entity in Unspace somehow being encoded into the fabric of Unspace is
  like the mind encoded into the magnetic field of the blackhole in {{ eater
  }}.

- Ahab, the Naeromathi who lets his quest for vengeance against the Architects
  blind him, is of course based on Ahab from {{ moby }}.

Once again I'm going to take a break to read {{ ba1 }}, and probably {{ wow }}
and {{ mb5 }}, before finishing the trilogy with {{ fa3 }}.
