{{ this_book }} is a transitional work in {{ this_series }} in many ways. Like
early entries---{{ tt1 }}, {{ tt2 }}, and even {{ tt3 }}---this book is
essentially a travel comic. Tintin visits a new country and finds himself
mixed up in some adventure. And like those early stories, Tintin still
operates under the logic of cartoons, but it's toned down. He doesn't knock
out a buffalo with a rubber tree slingshot like in {{ tt2 }}, but he _does_
jump a 15-foot wall by bouncing on a fat man's stomach and talk to elephants
with a trumpet.

In other ways, {{ this_book }} is moving toward the more modern works in the
series. It has a plot---the opium-smuggling ring---that runs through the whole
book and continues into {{ tt5 }}, making it the series's first two-part
story, like {{ tt11 }} and {{ tt12 }}, or {{ tt16 }} and {{ tt17 }}.

The story meanders from adventure to adventure, and the dialogue is
uninspired. Thomson and Thompson don't have a big enough part, and the lack of
Captain Haddock means Tintin doesn't have anyone to play off of. The art is
still great, though, and with far more variety of setting than {{ tt2 }}.
There are some beautiful panels, especially the half-page one of Tintin
escaping the Middle Eastern city while the army chases him. The mountain car
chase at the end reminds me of both the mountains {{ the_author }} drew in {{
tt16 }}, and also {{ doyles }} {{ final_problem }}, as the villain plunges to
his apparent death.

This book is mostly interesting as a glimpse of what the series would become.
On to {{ tt5 }} next.
