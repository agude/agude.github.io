{{ this_book }} is a transitional work in {{ this_series }} in many ways. Like
early works---{{ tt1 }}, {{ tt2 }}, and even {{ tt3 }}---this book is
essentially a travel comic. Tintin travels to a new country and finds himself
mixed up in some adventure. An like the early works, Tintin still operates
under the laws of cartoons, but it's toned down. He doesn't knock out a
buffalo with a rubber tree slingshot like in {{ tt2 }}, but he does jump a 15
foot wall by bouncing on a fat mans stomach and talk to elephants with a
trumpet.

In other ways, {{ this_book }} is closer to more modern works in the series:
it has a plot---the opium smuggling ring---the extends through the whole book
and even into {{ tt5 }}, making it the first two-part story like {{ tt11 }}
and {{ tt12 }}, or {{ tt16 }} and {{ tt17 }}.

The story meanders from adventure to adventure, and the dialogue is
uninspired. The Thomson and Thompson don't have a big enough party, and the
lack of Captain Haddock means Tintin has no one to play off of. The art is
still great though, and with far more variety of setting than {{ tt2 }}. There
are some beautiful panels, especially the half page one showing Tintin as he
escapes the middle-eastern city pursued by the army. The mountain car chase at
the end reminds me of both the mountains {{ the_author }} drew in {{ tt16 }},
and also {{ doyles }} {{ final_problem }} as the villain plunges to his
apparent death.

A book mostly interesting as a hint at what the series would become. On to {{
tt5 }} next.
