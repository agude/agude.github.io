{{ this_book }} is like a light-hearted version of {{ qntms }} {{
there_is_no_antimemetics_division }}, or {{ strosss }} {{ the_laundry_files }}
and {{ a_colder_war }}. It follows scientists at NITWITT as they study
Maxwell's demons, {{ dracula }}, magic wands, and dragons while dealing with
Soviet bureaucracy. On paper this should be _exactly_ my kind of story! I love
the "bureaucrats dealing with the supernatural" genre, and I've worked at LBL
and CERN, the kind of giant research institutes this book satirizes. But while
the ideas and characters are fun, there isn't really a story tying it all
together. {{ boris }} said they had the concept for a long time but struggled
"to think of a story or a plot for the adventure".[^boris] I don't think they
ever quite found one.

    > We came up with the idea of a story about wizards, witches,
    > sorcerers, and magicians a long time ago, at the end of the 1950s.
    > To begin with we had no idea of what might happen in it; all we knew
    > was that the heroes would be characters from the fairy tales,
    > legends, myths, and ghost stories of all cultures and times. And
    > that their adventures would take place against the backdrop of a
    > research institute with all its foibles, well known to one of us
    > from his own personal experience, and to the other from the many
    > stories recounted to him by his academic friends. We spent a long
    > time gathering together jokes and nicknames and amusing
    > characteristics for our future characters, and wrote them all down
    > on separate scraps of paper (which, as always happens, were later
    > lost). But no real advance took place; we were never able to think
    > of a story or a plot for the adventure.

{{ this_book }} is split into three loosely connected vignettes that wander
around somewhat aimlessly. The third, where they solve the mystery of
A-Janus/S-Janus, who is one person in two bodies, was my favorite because it
comes closest to a classic "slowly unveiled mystery" plot. The other two are
more slice-of-life around the institute and don't have a payoff like the
third. The first vignettes, which introduces the whole institute and concept,
has the least structure, which causes the book to stumble right from the
start.

{{ this_book }} shares some themes with {{ the_authors_possessive }} {{ picnic
}}. Both are interested in happiness: NITWITT's mission is to discover and
perfect human happiness, and in {{ picnic }} Red's final wish is for
"HAPPINESS, FREE, FOR EVERYONE, AND LET NO ONE BE FORGOTTEN!" They also both
deal with humans interacting with human-like simulacra. In {{ this_book_short
}}, the doubles are helpful, collecting your paycheck or going to parties so
you can work more, while in {{ picnic_short }} the artificial Arthur and Dina
feel much more sinister. The difference in tone---{{ this_book }} is
optimistic in a way {{ picnic }} is not---probably reflects when they were
written: {{ this_book_short }} came out during the liberalizing Khrushchev
thaw, while {{ picnic_short }} was written during the stagnation of the 70s.

{{ this_book }} also reminded me of several other works. The "institute that
contains anomalous items" is like the SCP foundation from {{
there_is_no_antimemetics_division }}. NITWITT has an infinite library like {{
borgess }} {{ the_library_of_babel }}. The protagonist travels into a
fictitious world is like Alice in {{ carrolls }} {{
alices_adventures_in_wonderland }}. And A-Janus/S-Janus moving backwards
through time reminded me of Moneta in {{ simmonss }} {{ hyperion }}.

Despite its faults, I love {{ the_authors_possessive }} characters and dialog.
There's a real plainness to how their characters talk that makes them feel
alive, almost like {{ ernest_hemingway }}. I have a bunch more of their books
on my list, and I'm looking forward to them because I know they can write
masterpieces even if they didn't manage it this time.

Up next is {{ time_war }} for the book club, and then I think I'll return to
the {{ cantos }} with {{ fall_of_hyperion }}.
