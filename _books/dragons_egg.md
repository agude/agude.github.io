<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a hard sci-fi novel by

first contact between humans and the Cheela: beings who live on a neutron
star.

{{ this_book }} is structured as a series of vignettes, each focusing on a
significant moment in the Cheela's history, such as their development of
agriculture, religion, migration to the southern hemisphere, first observation
of the human orbiter, detection of the scanning laser, and initial
communication with humans. This format means the book is light on plot, with
no overarching conflict beyond the advancement of the Cheela civilization, but
that is enough.

{{ this_book }} was partially inspired by {{ clements }} {{ gravity }}, but it
also reminded me of {{ flatland }}. Like the shapes in that book, the Cheela
are nearly two-dimensional due to the extreme gravitational gradient on their
neutron star. Similar to {{ flatland }}, much of the book explores the
civilization the Cheela have built. The Cheela are also reminiscent of the
beings briefly mentioned as living on a high-gravity world in {{ clarkes }} {{
childhoods_end }}. However, what {{ this_book }} most reminds me of is {{
deepness }}. Both novels feature humans orbiting an alien world, with aliens
vastly different from humans but narrated in an anthropomorphized manner, and
with the aliens' technology eventually advancing enough to establish contact with
the humans.

While I typically don't enjoy books that heavily rely on world-building, like
{{ suns }} or {{ quantum }}, the Cheela characters in each vignette possess
enough personality and "humanity" to keep me interested. I found Pink-Eye,
the Cheela equivalent of Jesus, to be both humorous and somewhat tragic. I
cheered for Swift-Killer, the astronomer-soldier who first conquered the East
Pole, and felt a sense of schadenfreude when Soother's Machiavellian empire
collapsed.

A fun addition to the hard science-fiction genre,[^text_book] I look forward
to reading the sequel, {{ starquake }}, next.

[^text_book]:
    {{ the_author }} describes {{ this_book }} as: "a textbook on neutron star
    physics disguised as a novel."
