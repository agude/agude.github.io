{{ this_book }} is told in vignettes, each one focusing on a moment in the
Cheela's history when they made some breakthrough: invented farming and
religion, migrated to the southern hemisphere, first observed the human
orbiter, detected the human's scanning laser, started communicating with the
humans, etc. Because of this format the book is plot-light---there is no
over-arching conflict other than the advancement of the Cheela civilization.
But that's enough.

{{ this_book }} reminds me of {{ flatland }}. Like the shapes, the Cheela are
_nearly_ two-dimensional, since the gravitational gradient on their star is so
high. And like {{ flatland }} much of the book is about the civilization the
Cheela have built. The Cheela are also similar to the beings mentioned briefly
as living on a high-gravity world in {{ clarkes }} {{ childhoods_end }}. But
what {{ this_book }} most reminds me of is {{ deepness }}. In both books there
are humans orbiting an alien world, with aliens that are extremely different
from humans but narrated in an anthropomorphized manner, and the alien's
technology eventually advances far enough to make contact with the humans.

Normally I don't love books that rely heavily on world building---like {{
suns}} or {{ quantum }}---but the Cheela characters in each vignette have
enough personality, enough "humanity", to keep me interested. I found
Pink-Eye, the Cheela Jesus, to be funny and a bit tragic; I was cheering for
Swift-Killer, the astronomer-soldier who first conquered the East Pole; and I
felt a pang of schadenfreude when Soother's Machiavellian empire collapsed.

A fun entry in the hard sci-fi genre,[^text_book] I look forward to reading
the sequel {{ starquake }} next.
