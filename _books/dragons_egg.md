{{ this_book }} is told in vignettes, each one focusing on a moment in the
Cheela's history when they made some breakthrough: invented farming and
religion, migrated to the southern hemisphere, first observed the human
orbiter, detected the human's scanning laser, started communicating with the
humans, etc. Because of this format the book is plot-light---there is no
over-arching conflict other than the advancement of the Cheela civilization.
But that's enough.

{{ this_book }} reminds me a lot of {{ flatland }}. Like the shapes, the
Cheela are _nearly_ two-dimensional, since the gravitational gradient on their
star is so high. They are also similar to the beings mentioned
briefly as living on a star in {{ clarkes }} {{ childhoods_end }}. But the
book {{ this_book }} most reminds me of is {{ deepness }}. In both books there
are humans orbiting an alien world, and the aliens---although extremely
different than humans---are anthropomorphized so that they seem incredibly
human. The aliens develop technologically and eventually make contact.
