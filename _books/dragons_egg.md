{{ this_book }} is told through a series of vignettes, each one capturing a
pivotal moment in the Cheela's civilization: the invention of farming and
religion, their migration to the southern hemisphere, their first observation
of the human orbiter, their detection of the scanning laser and their first
contact with the humans, and so on. Rather than following a single overarching
narrative, the book chronicles the gradual progression of the Cheela's
society, which is a compelling enough premise in itself.

{{ this_book }} was partially inspired by {{ clements }} {{ gravity }}, but it
also reminded me of {{ flatland }}. Like the shapes in that book, the Cheela
are nearly two-dimensional due to the extreme gravitational gradient on their
neutron star. Similar to {{ flatland }}, much of the book explores the
civilization the Cheela have built. The Cheela are also reminiscent of the
beings briefly mentioned as living on a high-gravity world in {{ clarkes }} {{
childhoods_end }}. However, what {{ this_book }} most reminds me of is {{
deepness }}. Both novels feature humans orbiting an alien world, with aliens
vastly different from humans but narrated in an anthropomorphized manner, and
with the aliens' technology eventually advancing enough to establish contact
with the humans.

While I typically don't enjoy books that rely almost entirely on
world-building, like {{ suns }} or {{ quantum }}, the Cheela characters in
each vignette possess enough personality and "humanity" to keep me invested. I
found Pink-Eye, the Cheela equivalent of Jesus, to be both humorous and
somewhat tragic. I cheered for Swift-Killer, the astronomer-soldier who first
conquered the East Pole, and felt a sense of schadenfreude when Soother's
Machiavellian empire collapsed.

A fun addition to the hard science-fiction genre,[^text_book] I look forward
to reading the sequel, {{ starquake }}, next.

[^text_book]:
    {{ the_author }} describes {{ this_book }} as: "a textbook on neutron star
    physics disguised as a novel."
