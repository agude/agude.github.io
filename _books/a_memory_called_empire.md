{{ this_book }} is a story of courtly intrigue in a science fiction empire.
Mahit is summoned suddenly to Teixcalaan to replace her predecessor, Yskander
Aghavn. She soon discovers he has been murdered, and that the empire is
lurching toward a succession crisis. Mahit and her liaison, Three Seagrass,
have to navigate the shifting allegiances and politics of the imperial court
while defending Lsel Station and trying to uncover the murderer.

A primary theme of {{ this_book }} is memory---how civilizations remember
themselves and their history, and how that shapes their behavior. Lsel
remembers through Imago lines, literally preserving the minds of those who
came before, while the Teixcalaanli do it through a cultural narrative carried
in poetry.

Another major theme is identity. It's clearest in Mahit and her Imago---a machine
that stores a previous mind-state and integrates it into your own. Is she still
herself once another's memories and personality are mixed into hers? The book
asks how much of a person is their mind, how much is their body and biology,
and how much is the culture they live in.

A subtler version of this theme plays out in the question of who belongs to the
Empire, and who doesn't. Who's on Mahit's side, and who's not? The question
"What is _we_?" comes up more than once, both in the context of Mahit and her
Imago of Yskander, and in her relationships with others.

There's a motif around star charts that ties into these themes. Star charts
define what's part of the Empire and what isn't, and they also resemble maps of
neurons in the brain. They show up in poems, above Mahit's bed, and even in the
names of characters.

As a book about an ambassador and an orator, it's the dialogue and the
characters that carry {{ this_book }}. The poetry feels a little forced at
times, but each character is rich and has their own agenda. Figuring out who
can be trusted---and when---is one of the joys of the story. The ending is
fitting, full of poetry, symbolism, and dramatic gestures, which feels right
for an Empire that sees itself as a living story.

This book reminded me of several others:

- The Stationers, with their Imago mind-backup devices, are like the
  Chelgrians and their Soulkeepers in {{ bankss }} {{ look_to_windward }}.
  Mahit, a diplomat with a second personality in her head, reminded me of
  Major Quilan and the personality of Admiral Huyler he carries. The
  ever-present cloudhooks are like {{ culture }} terminals.

- An empire with aptitude tests for imperial office---similar to Imperial
  China---reminds me of {{ bennetts }} {{ the_tainted_cup }}.

- The variety of minds---single minds, second personalities, group minds like the
  Sunlit and the shard pilots---felt like {{ wattss }} {{ blindsight }}.

- The poem posted on the network that spreads like wildfire reminded me of the
  way Peter and Valentine Wiggin influenced public discourse as Locke and
  Demosthenes in {{ cards }} {{ enders_game }}.

- The snippets of in-universe texts at the start of each chapter are like {{
  brunners }} {{ stand_on_zanzibar }}.

- The way Mahit's thoughts interrupt the narration reminded me of Harrier Du
  Bois in <cite class="video-game-title">Disco Elysium</cite>. The part where
  Mahit is waking up during and after surgery, her mind scrambled and trying to
  stabilize, echoed Harry waking to dialogue from his Ancient Reptilian Brain
  and Limbic System.

- The way I noticed the writing made me think of {{ wolfes }} {{
  shadow_of_the_torturer }}, with its slightly archaic prose and intentionally
  unclear descriptions.

I read {{ this_book }} for my book club, and I'm jumping right into the sequel,
{{ teix2 }}.
