One of the primary themes of this book is identity. This is most obvious with the protagonist and her Imagoâ€” Is she the same person once her personality has been mixed in with all the previous ones? but also how much of an identity is the endocrine system? and how much of it is the culture that you're living in? 

settler versions of this theme revolve around who is part of the empire and who is not. and as a court drama, who is part of our team and who is against us, which is always shifting. 

A related motif is around star charts. charts help you identify where you stand. and the star chart is awfully like neural network.
