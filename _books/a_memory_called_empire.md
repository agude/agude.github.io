{{ this_book }} is a story of courtly intrigue in a science fiction empire.
Mahit arrives on Teixcalaan and

One of the primary themes of this book is identity. This is most obvious with
the protagonist and her Imagoâ€” Is she the same person once her personality has
been mixed in with all the previous ones? but also how much of an identity is
the endocrine system? and how much of it is the culture that you're living in?

settler versions of this theme revolve around who is part of the empire and
who is not. and as a court drama, who is part of our team and who is against
us, which is always shifting.

A related motif is around star charts. charts help you identify where you
stand. and the star chart is awfully like neural network.

This book reminded me of several others:

- The Stationers, with their Imago mind-backup devices are like the Chelgrians
  with their Soulkeepers in {{ bankss }} {{ look_to_windward }}; Mahit, a
  diplomat with a second personality in her head, reminds me of Major Quilan
  and the personality of Admiral Huyler he carries. The ubiquitous cloudhooks
  are like {{ culture }} terminals.

- An empire with aptitude tests for imperial office---similar to Imperial
  China---reminds me of {{ bennetts }} {{ the_tainted_cup }}.

- The different types of minds---single minds, second personalities within a
  mind, group minds like the Sunlit and shard pilots---is like {{ wattss }} {{
  blindsight }}.

- The poem posted on the internet that spreads like wildfire reminds me of the
  impact Peter and Valentine Wiggin have posting as Locke and Demosthenes in
  {{ cards }} {{ enders_game }}.

- The voices in Mahit's head, especially as she is coming to during and after
  brain surgery, very roughly remind me of Harrier Du Bois waking up to the
  voices of his Ancient Reptilian Brain and the Limbic System beginning of
  <cite class="video-game-title">Disco Elysium</cite>.
