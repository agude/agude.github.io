{{ this_book }} is a story of courtly intrigue in a science fiction empire.
Mahit is summoned suddenly to Teixcalaan to replace her predecessor---Yskander
Aghavn. When she arrives she finds the capital in a state of 

One of the primary themes of {{ this_book }} is identity. It is most obvious
with Mahit and her Imago---a machine that stores previous mind-states and
incorporates them into your own. Is she the same person once another's
memories and personality are mixed with her own? The book questions how much
of a person is their mind, how much is their body and endocrine system, and
how much is the culture they live in.

A subtler version of this theme revolves around the question of who is part of
the Empire, and who is not, and who is on Mahit's side and who is against her.
The question of "What is _'we'_?" comes up several times in regards to both
Mahit and her Imago of Yskander, and of her and her allies.

There is a related motif is around star charts. They help you identify what is
and is not part of the Empire, and they also look like a map of neurons in the
brain. Star charts appear in poems, above Mahit's bed, and in the name of
characters.

Another theme is of memory, and how civilizations remember themselves and
their history. Lsel does it through Imago lines, literally preserving the
minds of the people who came before, while the Teixcalaanli do it through a
cultural narrative preserved in poetry.

As a book about an ambassador and an orator, the dialog and characters in {{
this_book }} are what carry it. The poetry feels a little forced at times, but
each character is rich and has their own agenda. Figuring out what characters
can be trusted, and when, is one of the joys of the narrative.

This book reminded me of several others:

- The Stationers, with their Imago mind-backup devices are like the Chelgrians
  with their Soulkeepers in {{ bankss }} {{ look_to_windward }}; Mahit, a
  diplomat with a second personality in her head, reminds me of Major Quilan
  and the personality of Admiral Huyler he carries. The ubiquitous cloudhooks
  are like {{ culture }} terminals.

- An empire with aptitude tests for imperial office---similar to Imperial
  China---reminds me of {{ bennetts }} {{ the_tainted_cup }}.

- The different types of minds---single minds, second personalities within a
  mind, group minds like the Sunlit and shard pilots---is like {{ wattss }} {{
  blindsight }}.

- The poem posted on the internet that spreads like wildfire reminds me of the
  impact Peter and Valentine Wiggin have posting as Locke and Demosthenes in
  {{ cards }} {{ enders_game }}.

- The snippets of in-universe texts at the start of each chapter is like {{
  brunners }} {{ stand_on_zanzibar }}.

- The way Mahit's mind interjects in the middle of the narrative reminds me of
  Harrier Du Bois in <cite class="video-game-title">Disco Elysium</cite>. The
  part where Mahit is waking up during and after her surgery, her mind
  confused and scrambling for a foothold, is like when Harry wakes to dialog
  from his Ancient Reptilian Brain and the Limbic System.

I read {{ this_book }} for my book club, and I'm jumping right into the sequel
{{ teix2 }}.
