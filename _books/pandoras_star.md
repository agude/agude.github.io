A sci-fi book that reads more like a thriller. I couldn't put <span
class="book-title">Pandora's Star</span> down because there was always a new
mystery that I wanted the answer to.

The book takes place in a universe where trains running through interstellar
wormholes are the main form of transportation. Inequality is rampant, with the
richest families (called dynasties) owning entire planets. Humans also can't
really die because everyone has a memory backups that can be loaded into a new
clone. Some of the characters struggle with the idea of the clone not really
being them (something I agree with) but this is sort of brushed over in the
book.

The main plot kicks off when a star suddenly disappears. Humans, being
curious, decide to find out why. This forces the human Commonwealth to build
their first real starships. Given that the title is "Pandora" you would
rightfully guess that humanity's curiosity is costly: they unleash an
aggressive alien species that launches a genocidal war against the unprepared
Commonwealth.

The book is **LONG** but the story keeps moving for the most part. The cast is
huge which makes the universe feel big, but also means that sometimes it's
hundreds and hundreds of pages before you return to a story thread.

There are space battles, ground battles, detectives chasing terrorists, and an
all powerful AI. The various plot lines all feel related although you can't
see exactly how yet. The ending is abrupt, but that's because <span
class="book-title">Pandora's Star</span> is the first half of the series,
which is concluded in {% include book_link.html title="Judas Unchained" %}.
