A sci-fi book that reads more like a thriller. I couldn't put it down because
there was always a new mystery that I wanted the answer to.

The book takes place in a universe where trains running through interstellar
wormholes are the main form of transportation. A star suddenly disappears and
of course humanity has to go see why, which means they need to build a
spaceship. Based on the title (Pandora...) you can guess what happens next.

The book is **LONG** but the story keeps moving for the most part. The cast is
huge which makes the universe feel big, but also means that sometimes it's
hundreds and hundreds of pages before you return to a story thread.

There are space battles, group battles, detectives chasing terrorists, and an
all powerful AI. The various plot lines all feel related although you can't
see exactly how yet.

I didn't know the book was part of a series (with the sequel {% include
book_link.html title="Judas Unchained" %}) so the ending felt a bit abrupt.
