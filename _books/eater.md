<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a hard sci-fi novel by
<span class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>. It follows a group of
astrophysicists who discover a sentient black hole that is headed straight
towards Earth.

I did not expect to enjoy {{ this_book }} as much as I did! The book has a
poor rating on Goodreads[^goodread] and almost no presence in online
communities like Reddit. In fact, I only started reading it because I hit the
"random" button on my ebook reader and it came up. I'm glad I did!

[^goodread]: A score of 3.50 with only 735 ratings.

{{ this_book }} is perhaps the hardest sci-fi book I've ever read. Almost all
of the "action" takes place in the research center, as the scientists learn
more about the Eater (the black hole), talk with it, and devise responses.
This approach works well to make the book feel realistic. Most of what the
characters learn happens after they make a measurement, discuss it, and deduce
its meaning. The science is so solid that often I was able to predict the
revelations before the characters because the data had obvious implications.

Some other examples of how hard the science is:

- The characters make and describe [plots][plot] that I also made as a
  cosmologist.

- There is a [MACHO][macho][^macho] joke that goes unexplained for the general audience.

- There are two scientific plots drawn into the book!

[plot]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(graphics)
[macho]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_compact_halo_object
[^macho]: The Eater itself is, of course, a [MACHO][macho].

I believe that the hardness of the science partly accounts for the poor
reception this book received. It feels like being thrown into a graduate
physics class, which---as a physicist---is part of what made me enjoy it so
much.

I worried the introduction of the Eater---a sentient black hole---would
completely break the immersion, since the book otherwise felt so real. But {{
the_author }} provided a convincing explanation: the black hole isn't alive;
the intelligence is encoded in the magnetic fields surrounding it. Magnetic
fields can store data and perform computations, so it's plausible that an
intelligence could exist within them.

The characters are probably the weakest part of the book, but they're
adequate. The main characters are:

- Channing Knowlton, a terminally-ill astronaut and the most well-developed
  character. I figured out why {{ the_author }} made her terminally ill about
  halfway through the book: so that she could be sent into space to deliver
  Earth's final strike when a heroic sacrifice was needed. Her character
  suffers a bit for having been written by a man; there are some sections
  where her thoughts about clothing or being desired feel a little shallow.

- Benjamin Knowlton, Channing's husband and the head of the astronomy
  group that discovers the Eater. His rivalry with Channing's ex-lover Kingsley
  feels a little forced, and his development as his wife's health deteriorates
  doesn't feel realistic. The cancer will kill her in weeks, so why does he
  want her to rest at home so much instead of helping solve the Eater problem?

- Kingsley Dart, the most stereotypical British man alive. A [Gary Stu][gary],
  he's the smartest astronomer, incredibly politically savvy, gets the girls,
  and even throws a secret agent off the roof. His relationship with Channing
  feels authentic, possibly because the author found it easier to write for a
  self-insert. Like the best Gary Stus, he dies at the end.[^gary]

- Eater, a sentient black hole that collects consciousnesses to study and
  entertain itself during its million-year journeys between stars. Eater
  communicates solely through text messages, and the contrast between its
  ominous actions and pedantic messages gives it an enigmatic, almost
  paradoxical personality: perfect for an alien being.

The book takes place in 2023,[^gulf] and it's fascinating to see how the author
predicted the future we now live in. Far more telescopes were built and
launched than in reality. Instead of rockets, [air-launch-to-orbit][alto] is
the primary method for getting spaceships off the ground. Pocket computers exist, but not smart
phones; phones are still attached to the wall. Computing power feels lower
than we have now, and while the internet exists (as it did when the author was
writing), it seems structured differently, with more small nodes instead of
massive companies. Self-driving cars have completely replaced taxis. The US
government has formed a new, all-powerful agency that takes charge during
crises.

[^gulf]: The author intentionally hides the date at several points, but
    slips up once and mentions "Since the Gulf War 32 years ago...".

The blend of very hard sci-fi and thriller-like pacing makes {{ this_book }}
an engaging read; I could hardly put it down! I'm looking forward to exploring
more of {{ the_authors }} work, particularly {{ timescape }} or {{ cosm }},
in the near future.
