<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a hard sci-fi novel by
<span class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>. It follows a group of
astrophysicists who discover a black hole that is headed straight towards
Earth.

I did not expect to enjoy {{ this_book }} as much as I did! The book has a
poor rating on Goodreads[^goodread] and almost no presence in online
communities like Reddit. In fact, I only started reading it up because I hit
the "random book" button on my ebook reader and it came up. I'm glad I did!

[^goodread]: A score of 3.50 with only 735 ratings.

{{ this_book }} is maybe the hardest sci-fi book I've ever read.
Almost all of the "action" in {{ this_book }} takes places in the research
center, as the scientists learn more about the Eater, talk with it, and come
up with responses. I think this works well to make the book feel realistic.
Almost everything the characters learn happens after they make a measurement,
discuss it, and decide what it must mean. The science is so rock solid that
often I was able to predict what the revelation was before the characters
because the data had an obvious implication.

Some other examples of how hard the science is:

- The characters make [plots][plot] that I also made as a cosmologist.

- There is a [MACHO][macho][^macho] joke that goes completely unexplained for the audience.

- There are two scientific plots drawn into the book!

[plot]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(graphics)
[macho]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_compact_halo_object
[^macho]: The Eater itself is of course a [MACHO][macho].

I think that, in some ways, the hardness of the science accounts for the poor
reception this book got, it feels like being thrown into a graduate physics
class, which---as a physicists---is partly what made me enjoy it so much.

The realism made me worry that the introduction of the Eater---a sentient
black hole---would completely break the immersion. But {{ the_author }} had an
explanation that proved convincing: the black hole isn't alive, the
intelligence is encoded in the magnetic fields surrounding it. Magnetic fields
can store data, can perform computations, so of course you could put an
intelligence in them.

The characters are probably the weakest part of the book, but they're
adequate. The three main characters are:

- Channing Knowlton, a terminally-ill astronaut and the most well developed
  character. I figured out why {{ the_author }} needed her to be dying about
  half way through the book: so that she could be sent into space to deliver
  Earth's final strike when a heroic sacrifice was needed. I think her
  character suffers a bit for having been written by a man, because there are
  some sections where she thinks about clothing, or how she wants to be
  desired, that read a little shallow.

- Benjamin Knowlton, the husband of Channing, and the head of the astronomy
  group that discovers Eater. His rivalry with Channing's ex-lover Kingsley
  feels a little forced, and his development as his wife deteriorates and
  dies doesn't feel real. The cancer will kill her in weeks, why do you want
  her to rest at home so much?

- Kingsley Dart, the most stereotypical British man alive. A bit of a [Gary
  Stu][gary], he is the smartest astronomer, incredibly politically savvy,
  gets the girls, and even throws a secret agent off the roof. His
  relationship with Channing feels authentic, possibly because the author
  found it easier to write for a self-insert. Like the best Gary Stus, he dies
  at the end.[^gary]

The books takes place in 2023,[^gulf] and its fun to see how the author
predicted the future we now live in. Far more telescopes were built and
launched than in reality. Instead of rockets, [air-launch-to-orbit][alto] is
the way spaceships get off the ground. Pocket computers exist, but not smart
phones; phones are still attached to the wall. Computing power feels lower
than we have now, and the internet exists (it of course existed when the
author was writing) but feels like it's structured much differently, with more
small nodes instead of massive companies. Self driving cars have completely
replaced taxis.

[^gulf]: At several points the author intentionally hides the date, but at one
    point slips up and mentions "Since the Gulf War 32 years ago...".
