The sequel to {% include book_link.html title="Pandora's Star" %}, <span
class="book-title">Judas Unchained</span> continues right where the last one
left off, but with the action ramped up to 11. The various storylines and
loose threads come together one by one until it's the good guys racing against
the bad guys for the fate of the universe.

With a little knowledge of [Chekhov's Gun][gun], I could see how the ending
had to unfold with a few hundred pages to go, but I still found it thrilling.
The strong conclusion makes this the slightly better of the two books in the
Commonwealth Saga.
