The sequel to {% include book_link.html title="Pandora's Star" %}, <cite
class="book-title">Judas Unchained</cite> continues right where the last one
left off, but with the action ramped up to 11. The various storylines and
loose threads come together one by one until it's the good guys racing against
the bad guys for the fate of the universe.

But the story isn't perfect. One part that falls flat is the fact that
multiple characters begin worrying about humanity's plan to genocide the Prime
aliens, the same aliens who have launched two genocidal campaigns against
humanity (and one successful genocide against another species). It doesn't
feel realistic to be concerned about the moral high ground as millions or
billions die.

With a little knowledge of [Chekhov's Gun][gun], I could see how the ending
had to unfold with a few hundred pages to go, but I still found it thrilling.
The strong conclusion makes this the slightly better of the two books in the
Commonwealth Saga.
