<cite class="book-title">The Fractal Prince</cite> is the second book in the
Jean le Flambeur series. While the first book, {% include book_link.html
title="The Quantum Thief" %}, left me underwhelmed, the second book more than
lived up to the hype.

In {% include book_link.html title="The Quantum Thief" %}, le Flambeur went to
Mars to recover his memories. In <cite class="book-title">The Fractal
Prince</cite>, he heads to Earth to gather tools for his heist. Earth has its
own unique culture, technology, and characters, just like Mars. And again,
Rajaniemi throws the reader into the deep end to figure things out, but this
time he gives us a little help. Some characters ask questions the reader
likely has, providing small bits of exposition missing from the first book.

Earth's culture is loosely based on <cite class="book-title">One Thousand and
One Nights</cite>---tales within tales have power, minds without bodies are
called Jinn, and the desert of wildcode is a constant threat.

<cite class="book-title">The Fractal Prince</cite> expanded the universe and
filled in details: characters developed more personality, faction goals were
revealed, and the stakes felt higher.

After almost not finishing the first book, I'm glad I powered through to <cite
class="book-title">The Fractal Prince</cite>. I look forward to the next book,
{% include book_link.html title="The Causal Angel" %}.
