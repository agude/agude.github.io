<span class="book-title">The Fractal Prince</span> is the second book in the
Jean le Flambeur series. While the first book, {% include book_link.html
title="The Quantum Thief" %}, left me underwhelmed, the second book more than
lived up to the hype the series have received.

In {% include book_link.html title="The Quantum Thief" %}, le Flambeur
traveled to Mars to recover his memories. In <span class="book-title">The
Fractal Prince</span>, le Flamebeur heads to Earth to gather some tools he
will need to pull off his heist. Earth, like Mars, has it's own unique
culture, technology, and characters. And just like in the first book,
Rajaniemi throws the reader in the deep end and lets them figure it out
for themselves.

Earth and the culture are roughly based on {% include book_link.html
title="One Thousand and One Nights" %}---there are tales within tales, these
stories have power over people, there are minds without bodies called Jinn,
the desert of wildcode is a constant threat.

<span class="book-title">The Fractal Prince</span> started expanding its
universe and filling in details: characters developed more personality,
the goals of various factions were revealed, and the stakes felt higher.

After almost not finishing the first book, I am glad I powered through and got
to <span class="book-title">The Fractal Prince</span>. I'm looking forward to
the next book, {% include book_link.html title="The Causal Angel" %}.
