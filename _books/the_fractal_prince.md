<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. While the first
book, {% include book_link.html title="The Quantum Thief" %}, left me
underwhelmed, the second book more than lived up to the hype.

In {{ quantum_thief }}, le Flambeur went to Mars to recover his memories. In
{{ this_book }}, he heads to Earth to gather tools for his heist. Earth has
its own unique culture, technology, and characters, just like Mars. And again,
{{ the_author }} throws the reader into the deep end to figure things out, but
this time he gives us a little help. Some characters ask questions the reader
likely has, providing small bits of exposition missing from the first book.

Earth's culture is loosely based on {{ one_thousand}}---tales within tales
have power, minds without bodies are called Jinn, and the desert of wildcode
is a constant threat.

{{ this_book }} expanded the universe and filled in details: characters
developed more personality, faction goals were revealed, and the stakes felt
higher.

After almost not finishing the first book, I'm glad I powered through to {{
this_book }}. I look forward to the next book, {{ causal_angel }}.
