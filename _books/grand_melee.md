After wrapping up the Cinto DaSelva campaign in {{ w4 }}, the Chevaliers enter
the Grand Melee, a gigantic mech-tournament held every two years. The
tournament's structure borrows heavily from modern [battle royale video
games][br_game], which in turn were inspired by {{ battle_royale }} by {{
takami }}. Teams face off in a last-team-standing format with shrinking
boundaries and power-ups. There are even streamers who are more focused on
chatting with their audiences than fighting.

I was genuinely surprised by how the Chevaliers' run in the tournament ended.
I expected that, even though Vandal was ordered to prioritize making the
company look good over winning, the author would find a way for him to do
both. Instead, Vandal negotiates contracts to put other teams ahead of his own
and ultimately disqualifies his own Chevaliers squad for a quick payday. He is
becoming a true mercenary.

{{ this_book }} starts to hint at a broader universe with the introduction of
new factions. There's an English mercenary company led by Captain Tanith
(possibly a nod to {{ abnetts }} {{ tanith }} or sci-fi author {{ tanith_lee
}}), Gundam-style Japanese mechs, and French AI-driven mechs. Several
characters also have their cultural heritages highlighted for the first time.
It feels like {{ the_author }} is laying the groundwork for a major expansion
of the universe in the next few books. The author also drops not-so-subtle
hints about a coming major conflict.

One critique I have is that the author frequently references events from
earlier books---the Paladin Devils from {{ w1 }}, Vandal's bond with his mech
from {{ w2 }}, and the various battles from {{ w3 }} and {{ w4 }}---but
doesn't provide much context or refreshers. I used to dislike it when authors
recapped earlier books; it felt like a crutch for readers jumping into the
middle of a series instead of starting from the beginning. But reading {{
series }} as it's released has changed my mind. A bit of a reminder would help
when it has been months or years since I read the previous books.

Once I finished, I found myself wishing there was more to read. I'm already
looking forward to {{ the_author }}'s next book in the series, {{ w6 }}.
