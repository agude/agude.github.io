After ending the Cinto DaSelva campaign in {{ w4 }}, the Chevaliers enter a
squad in the Grand Melee, a huge mech tournament held every two years. The
tournament structure is modeled after modern [battle royal video
games][br_game], which are themselves based on the {{ battle_royale }} by {{
takami }}, with multiple teams competing in a last-team-standing tournament
with shrinking boundaries and power ups. There are even streamers in the
tournament more interested in talking to their chat than fighting.

I was surprised by how the Chevaliers' tournament ended! I assumed that, even
though Vandal was instructed to make the mercenary company look good rather
than win the tournament, that the author would find a way for him to do both.
Instead, Vandal negotiates multiple contracts to put other teams ahead of his
own, and finally disqualifies his own Chevaliers team for a quick payday.

{{ this_book }} starts hinting at the existence of many more national
factions. There is an English mercenary company led by Captain Tanith (perhaps
a reference to {{ abnetts }} {{ tanith }}, or sci-fi author {{ tanith_lee }}),
Japanese Gundam-like mechs, and French AI mechs. Several characters are given
prominent new heritages. It feels like {{ the_author }} is preparing to really
expand the universe in the next few books.

One critique of the book is that the author is constantly referencing events
from previous books---the Paladin Devils from {{ w1 }}, Vandal's strong
connection with his mech from {{ w2 }}, and of course the various battles from
{{ w3 }} and {{ w4 }}---but he doesn't give the reader a refresher on them. I
used to be annoyed when authors added summaries of previous books to their
work, it felt like a sop <!-- TODO: better word --> for people who jumped into
the middle of the series and who should have just read the previous books! But
since I'm reading the {{ series }} series as it comes out, I would find the
reminders helpful.
