<cite class="book-title">Ymir</cite> is the second book in the War Horses
series, keeping <span class="nowrap">{% include book_link.html
title="Chevalier" %}'s</span> action and quick pacing while adding more
backstory, character development, and a more complex plot.

The story follows Vandal as he goes through training on his homeworld, saves a
classmate from assassination, and defends an ice-world from a space-Viking
raids.

Like {% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}, <cite
class="book-title">Ymir</cite> explores people being small in an uncaring,
vast universe. The Autumn Chevaliers fail to protect the civilians, sustaining
horrifying losses in their escape. Lifelong friendships break. Yet unlike {%
include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}, I enjoyed reading every
page.

The plot develops beyond Chevalier's linearity but exposes some pacing and
writing weaknesses:

- _Subplots end abruptly._ Vandal discovering his classmate is an oligarch's
  daughter. He saves her from assassins and just as intrigue builds, she
  disappears from the story.

- _Plot points also appear without foreshadowing, leaving them feeling
  unnatural._ Vandal has an oddly strong connection to his mech, seeing
  through its eyes without using his VR helmet. This is revealed mid-chapter
  with no lead up. A missed opportunity to build suspense as the evidence
  mounts.

Despite writing flaws, the richer story and characters outperform the first
book. I look forward to the next,
