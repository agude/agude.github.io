<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series, keeping <span
class="nowrap">{% book_link "Chevalier" %}'s</span> action
and quick pacing while adding more backstory, character development, and a
more complex plot.

The story follows Vandal as he goes through training on his homeworld, saves a
classmate from assassination, and defends an ice-world from space-Viking
raids.

Like {{ consider_phlebas }}, {{ this_book }} explores people being small in an
uncaring, vast universe. The Autumn Chevaliers fail to protect the civilians,
sustaining horrifying losses in their escape. Lifelong friendships break. Yet
unlike {{ consider_phlebas }}, I enjoyed reading every page.

The plot develops beyond {{ chevalier }}'s linearity but exposes some pacing
and writing weaknesses:

- _Subplots end abruptly._ Vandal discovering his classmate is an oligarch's
  daughter. He saves her from assassins and just as intrigue builds, she
  disappears from the story.

- _Plot points also appear without foreshadowing, leaving them feeling
  unnatural._ Vandal has an oddly strong connection to his mech, seeing
  through its eyes without using his VR helmet. This is revealed mid-chapter
  with no lead up. A missed opportunity to build suspense as the evidence
  mounts.

Despite writing flaws, the richer story and characters outperform the first
book. I look forward to the next, {{ serpent_valley }}.
