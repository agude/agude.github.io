<span class="book-title">Ymir</span> is the second book in the War Horses
series. It keeps the action and quick pacing of the first book,
{% include book_link.html title="Chevalier" %}, but adds in more backstory,
more character development, and a more intricate plot.

The book follows Vandal again as he goes through training on his home world,
saves a classmate from assassination, and is deployed on the ice-worlds to
defend a city from a space-Viking raid.

In some ways, <span class="book-title">Ymir</span> is dealing with the same
theme as {% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}: that people
are small and the universe is big and uncaring. The Autumn Chevaliers fail to
protect the civilians and millions are left at the mercy of the raiders. They
sustain horrifying loses. They barely escape. Lifelong friendships are broken.
But unlike {% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}, I enjoyed
reading every page.

The plot is more developed than the very linear plot of {% include
book_link.html title="Chevalier" %}, but that exposes some weakness in the
pacing and writing.

The first is that subplots end abruptly. For example: Vandal discovers one
member of his training class is the daughter of a very important oligarch. He
ends up saving her from assassins. And just as I was getting excited to find
out more she is ushered out of the narrative never to be seen again (until the
next book).

The second is that plot points sometimes appear without any foreshadowing,
making them feel unnatural. Vandal has an unnaturally strong connection with
his mech, allowing him to see through its eyes even when not using the VR
headset. This is revealed in the middle of the chapter without any hint its
coming. It would have been a good opportunity to leave the reader guessing as
the evidence slowly fell into place.

But, despite the weaknesses in the writing, the story and characters are
better than the first book in the series. I am looking forward to picking up
the sequel, {% include book_link.html title="Serpent Valley" %}.
