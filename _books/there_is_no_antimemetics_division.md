<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is a book about
researchers trying to control dangerous antimemes---ideas that can't be
thought---and how you might combat a foe you can't even remember exists.

{{ this_book }} is {{ the_authors }} rewrite of his {{ original }}. I thought
the strongest part of the {{ original }} was the first half, written as
disjointed short stories with tight plotting. The weakest part was the second
half, where the author tried to stitch them into a larger narrative. The
execution felt shallow, and the world it described felt like a stage just wide
enough to contain the action, with nothing beyond the edges.

This rewrite fixes all of that. The short stories keep their pacing, and some
are even trimmed to be tighter and fit more cleanly into the overall story. {{
the_author }} adds just a few more hints and signposts, which help make the
connections clearer. A couple of Unknown Objects that were mentioned in the
first book and then sort of vanished from the plot are expanded here and tied
directly into the main storyline. Everything builds toward the same conclusion
instead of pulling in different directions. The added signposts also make the
cyclical nature of the conflict clearer---how people keep trying the same
thing, keep losing, and how multiple Antimemetics Divisions have already been
wiped out by UO-3125.

{{ this_book }} is a book you read for the ideas and concepts, and they're
fantastic: that there are antimemes, ideas which cannot be remembered. How do
you study an idea you can't keep in your head? How do you fight something you
forget every time you leave the room? How do you win a war against an idea
that will kill you as soon as you think it? The world and its complexities are
introduced naturally through the short-story chapters, so by the time the
narrative really kicks off, you have a solid grounding without lore dumps.

I liked this book a lot. I love stories built around "boring bureaucrats
trying to control cosmic horrors" like {{ strosss_lastname }} {{ colder_war }}
and {{ laundry_files }}.[^stross] The short story format keeps the momentum
up; the tension builds but gives you enough slack to breathe, and despite the
horrors, there's hope. That was something missing from the first book, which
felt like things were only going to get worse and the characters would only
fail.

[^stross]:
    {{ the_author }} thanks {{ stross }} in the acknowledgments for "help[ing]
    me out at several critical early points in this journey".

{{ the_author }} revisits ideas he explored in {{ valuable_humans }}.
Researcher Hix has a "do not upload" directive filed to prevent the
Organization from uploading his consciousness if he dies or is near death. {{
the_author }} explored the horrifying consequences of creating uploaded
minds---and how easy it is to ignore their humanity---in {{ lena }} and {{
driver }}.[^lena] One of the researchers references the quote _"Sending this
message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful
culture."_, the warning Sandia National Laboratories wanted to convey about
nuclear waste disposal. That same message shows up in {{ powerful_culture }},
about disposing of dangerous waste to other dimensions.

[^lena]: {{ lena }} is my favorite short story of the last decade.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of a few other works as well. The cosmic horrors
echo {{ lovecrafts_lastname }} {{ cthulhu }}. Struggling with things beyond
understanding is a core theme of {{ arkady_and_boris_strugatskys }} {{
roadside_picnic }}, and a key influence of the [SCP Foundation][scp], which
this book is based on. Adam walking through an abandoned English city
devastated by UO-3125 parallels {{ days_later }} . UO-3125 itself felt like
the Blight in {{ vinges_lastname }} {{ fire_upon_the_deep }} in how it spreads
via hazardous information. Hix and Adam talking in lawn chairs in the memory
of a barbecue they both attended reminded me of how the Bobs meet in virtual
reality in {{ bobiverse }}. Not being able to see a threat right in front of
you recalls the Scramblers in {{ wattss_lastname }} {{ blindsight }}, which
move only when our eyes saccade. There's even a nod to Launch Arcologies from
{{ simcity }}.

I loved this rewrite, and I'm excited at the possibility of getting more
Antimemetics stories, which {{ the_author }} has hinted at. Up next is {{
darfsteller }} and then probably {{ saturday }} while I'm in the mood for
bureaucracy and the supernatural, before I really must start {{ time_war }}
for my book club.
