{{ this_book }} is {{the_authors }} rewrite of his {{ original }}. I thought
the strongest part of the {{ original }} was the first half, written as
disjointed short stories with tight pacing. The weakest part was the second
half, where the author tried to form them into the base of a larger narrative.
The execution felt shallow, and the world it described like a stage that was
just wide enough to contain the action, but with nothing else there.

This rewrite fixes all of those problems! The short stories maintain their
pacing, and some are even edited down to be tighter and fit better into the
overall storyline. {{ the_author }} adds in just a few more hints and
signposts, which help make it clearer how they're all related. No longer was I
left wondering if two parts of the book were related or just haphazardly
similar. Everything builds towards the same conclusion instead of pulling in
opposite directions.

{{ this_book }} is built on a fantastic concept: that there are antimemes,
ideas which can not be remembered. How does one study an idea you can't keep
in your head? How do you fight something that you forget about every time you
leave the room?

The world building is done fantastically through the introductory short
stories.

It's about remembering and forgetting.

Memory and identity

The ecology of ideas

Institutional blindess is real + bureaucracy

Cosmic horror (cthulu)
