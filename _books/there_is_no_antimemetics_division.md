class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is a book about
researchers trying to control dangerous Antimemes---ideas that can't be
thought---and how you might combat a foe you can't even remember exists.

{{ this_book }} is {{the_authors }} rewrite of his {{ original }}. I thought
the strongest part of the {{ original }} was the first half, written as
disjointed short stories with tight pacing. The weakest part was the second
half, where the author tried to form them into the base of a larger narrative.
The execution felt shallow, and the world it described like a stage that was
just wide enough to contain the action, but with nothing else there.

This rewrite fixes all of those problems! The short stories maintain their
pacing, and some are even edited down to be tighter and fit better into the
overall storyline. {{ the_author }} adds in just a few more hints and
signposts, which help make it clearer how they're all related. A couple
Unknown Objects that were mentioned in the first book and then sort of
vanished from the story are instead expanded and tied into the main plot.
Everything builds towards the same conclusion instead of pulling in opposite
directions. <!-- TODO: Want to mention the cyclical nature, people keep trying
to same thing and losing, there have been multiple Antimemetics divisions,
3125 has eaten them all. And that's clearer and easier to understand with the
improved signposts. -->

{{ this_book }} is one you read for the ideas and concept, and they are
fantastic: that there are antimemes, ideas which can not be remembered. How
does one study an idea you can't keep in your head? How do you fight something
that you forget about every time you leave the room? The world and its
complexities are introduced naturally through the short-story chapters, so by
the time the narrative really kicks off you have a solid grounding without
lore dumps.

I liked this book a lot. I love stories that have the concept of "boring
bureaucrats trying to control cosmic horrors" like {{ strosss_lastname }} {{
colder_war }} and {{ laundry_files }}.[^stross] The short story format keeps
the pacing high, and the tension builds but lets off enough to give you a
rest. And despite the horrors there is hope. That's something I was missing in
the first book which felt like things were only ever going to get worse and
the characters would only fail.

[^stross]:
    {{ the_author }} thanks {{ stross }} in the acknowledgments for "help[ing]
    me out at several critical early points in this journey".

{{ the_author }} revisits some of the ideas he explored in {{ valuable_humans
}}. Researcher Hix has a "do not upload" directive filed to keep the
Organization from uploading his consciousness if he dies or is near death. {{
the_author }} explored the horrifying consequences of creating uploaded
minds---and how easy it is to ignore their humanity---in {{ lena }} and {{
driver }}.[^lena] One of the researchers references the quote _"Sending this message was
important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture."_, the
warning message Sandia National Lab wanted to convey about nuclear waste
disposal. The same message is referenced in {{ powerful_culture }}, about
disposing of dangerous waste to other dimensions.

[^lena]: {{ lena }} is my favorite short story of the last decade.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of a few other works as well. The cosmic horrors
are like {{ lovecrafts_lastname }} {{ cthulhu }}. Dealing with things beyond
understanding is a core theme of {{ arkady_and_boris_strugatskys }} {{
roadside_picnic }}, and a key influence of the [SCP Foundation][scp] upon
which this work is based. Adam walking through an abandoned English city
devastated by UO-3125 was similar to {{ days_later }}. UO-3125 itself was like
the Blight in {{ vinges_lastname }} {{ fire_upon_the_deep }} in how it could
spread itself via hazardous information. Hix and Adam conversing in lawn
chairs in a memory of a barbecue they both attended reminded me of how the
Bobs meet in virtual reality in {{ bobiverse }}. Not being able to see a
threat right in front of your reminds me of the Scramblers in {{
wattss_lastname }} {{ blindsight }}, which move only when our eyes saccade.
There is a reference to Launch Arcologies, from {{ simcity }}.

I loved this rewrite, and I'm excited at the prospect of getting more
Antimemetics stories, which {{ the_author }} has hinted at.
