<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>, is the ninth <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> book. It explores themes of mind,
consciousness, and punishment through the Culture's attempt to stop other
civilizations from running virtual hells to torture their own citizens.

In {{ c7 }}, the Chelgrians use soulkeepers to copy their mind-states at death
so they can be brought into a heaven created by their sublimed ancestors. {{
this_book }} expands on that idea and explores the morality of uploading minds
to virtual hells, where they are tortured forever instead of reaching heaven.
Many galactic civilizations run hells for their people, and others---including
the Culture---oppose the practice. Both sides agree to settle the issue
through a virtual conflict called the _War in Heaven_. The Culture declines to
participate to maintain the appearance of fairness. Early on, we learn that
the anti-hell side is losing and is considering escalating the conflict into
the real world.

{{ this_book }} has a fantastic set of characters:

- Joiler Veppers: A deceitful business magnate and playboy, the most powerful
  man in the pan-human Sichultian Enablement, and the owner of the companies
  running most of the hells.

- Lededje Y'breq: Veppers's slave, murdered by him in the first chapter but
  reincarnated in the Culture after her mind-state is copied.

- Gyorni Vatueil: A virtual soldier in the _War in Heaven_, who rises through
  the ranks and is pivotal in escalating the war into the real world.

- Prin and Chay: Pavuleans who infiltrate their species' hell to expose its
  horrors. Prin escapes, but Chay's mind is too broken, leaving her trapped.

- Yime Nsokyi: A Culture Contact agent in the Quietus branch, dealing with the
  dead, reincarnated, and virtual mind-states.

- The _Falling Outside The Normal Moral Constraints_ (_FOTNMC_): An
  _Abominator_-class Culture warship that brings Y'breq back to her home planet.

{{ this_book }} is my favorite {{ culture }} novel so far, narrowly beating
out {{ c3 }}. Its multiple storylines are expertly woven together to converge
at the end, giving the reader a broad view of the narrative while keeping a
fast pace. {{ the_author }} maintains this momentum by shifting between plots
in the same chapter, developing the characters and world piece by piece while
ending on cliffhangers to maintain suspense. This sense of anticipation is
mirrored by the _FOTNMC_, who---like the reader---is excited by the prospect
of finally unleashing its full destructive power.

This novel, unlike {{ commonwealth }}, explores different beliefs about
whether a copy of your mind is still you. Some characters, like Y'breq,
consider their backup to be a continuation of their original self. Others,
like Chay and Prin, try to limit themselves to a single active mind that can
be merged back into them to preserve their sense of self. Chay fails at this,
as her body wakes up, leaving two distinct versions of her. For others,
multiple concurrent minds are a natural part of their existence: _FOTNMC_ is a
distributed consciousness across its multiple hulls and avatars. Vatueil has
multiple independent copies that are merged together upon "death" and even
allows one version to be turned off, confident that his larger "self"
persists.

There are several twists. Veppers, clearly evil, is revealed to be (for his
own benefit) on the anti-hell side. The Culture's neutrality is
ambiguous---they want to end the hells but have pledged not to interfere. The
most significant twist comes in the epilogue: Vatueil is revealed to be
Cheradenine Zakalwe from {{ c3 }}. This implies that Special Circumstances has
been involved in the _War in Heaven_ all along, making the reader reevaluate
what parts of the book were part of their scheme. It's worth noting that the
Culture often deploys Zakalwe on the side they want to lose---in this case, as
a pro-hell mole on the anti-hell side.

In previous {{ this_series }} books, I sometimes felt a slight detachment from
the characters and settings. For reasons I can't fully explain, {{ this_book
}} pulled me in completely, immersing me in its world.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of several other books: the hacking-as-battle
scenes echo The Detective's Tale in {{ hyperion }}; the virtual hells recall
the Shrike and its tree of pain; and the many battles involving Vatueil are
like the soldier traveling through time to fight the Shrike over and over.
Y'breq's quantum entanglement transfer brought to mind how the Bobs create new
versions in {{ bob1 }}. {{ banks }} notes that the galaxy's dead outnumber the
living, which parallels {{ so2001 }}'s line: "Behind every man now alive stand
thirty ghosts, for that is the ratio by which the dead outnumber the living."
The virtual hells themselves are reminiscent of the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine
episode <cite class="tv-show-title">Hard Time</cite>, where Chief O'Brien
suffers PTSD after receiving memories of a 20-year imprisonment, and also the
virtual heavens from {{ blindsight }}.

It's bittersweet to move on to {{ c10 }}, the final Culture book. Before I do,
I'm reading {{ grand_melee }}, the fifth book in the {{ war_horses }} series,
which was just released.
