<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>, is the ninth <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> book. It explores themes of the
mind, what it means to be alive, and punishment through the Culture's attempt
to stop other civilizations from running virtual hells to torture their own
citizens.

In {{ c7 }}, the Chelgrians use soulkeepers to copy their mind-state when they
die so that they can be brought into a heaven created by their sublimed
ancestors. {{ this_book }} expands on that idea, and explores the morality of
uploading minds to virtual hells, where they will be tortured forever, instead
of heaven. Many of the galactic civilizations run hells for their people, and
many more---including the Culture---oppose the practice. Both sides agree to
settle the issue in a virtual war called the _War in Heaven_. The Culture
voluntarily declines to participate in the war in order to keep up the
appearance of fairness. We learn of the war early in the book, and at the same
time learn that the anti-hell side is losing and thinking of escalating the
war into the real world.

{{ this_book }} has a fantastic set of characters:

- Joiler Veppers: A deceitful business magnet and playboy, the most powerful
  man in the pan-human Sichultian Enablement, and the owner of the companies
  running most of the hells.

- Lededje Y'breq: Veppers's slave, who he murders in the first chapter, but
  whose mind-state is copied and used to reincarnate her in the Culture.

- Gyorni Vatueil: A virtual solider in the _War in Heaven_ on the anti-hell
  side, who moves up the ranks and is responsible for the war moving into the
  real.

- Prin and Chay: Pavulean who infiltrate their specie's hell to expose the
  horror. Prin is able to escape but Chay's mind is too broken and she remains
  trapped.

- Yime Nsokyi: A Culture contact agent in the Quietus branch, who deal with
  the dead, reincarnated, and virtual mind-states.

- The _Falling Outside The Normal Moral Constraints_: An _Abominator_-class
  Culture warship, the _FOTNMC_ brings Y'breq back to her home planet.

{{ this_book }} is my favorite {{ culture }} novel so far, just edging out {{
c3 }}. The multiple storylines, each carefully directed to meet at the end of
the book, <!-- TODO -->. {{ the_author }} keeps the perfect pace by shifting
between plots in the same chapter, developing them and the world piece by
piece and often ending on a cliff hanger to keep the reader in anticipation.
The pacing and sense of anticipation are reinforced by the _FOTNMC_, who like
the reader, is excited by the prospect of getting to finally fire its weapons
in anger.

The mind, and what it means to be "alive" <!-- TODO: Better wording than
alive. Sentient? --> are a core theme of the novel. Y'breq's mind is copied on
her death and used to reincarnate her. Chay, Prin, and Vatueil are simulated
minds copied from real people, and in the case of Chay, resulting in multiple
copies as her real self wakes up while her virtual self remains in hell.
_FOTNMC_ is, of course, a completely constructed Mind. _FOTNMC_'s original
avatar is a human whose mind is suppressed so the ship can control them.
Unlike {{ commonwealth }}, {{ this_book }} grapples with the fact that a
backup isn't really you, first by having Chay's body wake up while her virtual
copy continues in hell, and later explicitly when a Culture pilot is thinking
about her imminent death.

There are several twists. Veppers is clearly evil, but we learn that he is
also (for his own benefit) on the anti-hell side. It is unclear which side the
Culture is on, as they want to end the hells but also pledged to be neutral.
The largest and most important twist is delivered in the epilogue: that
Vatueil is the man called Cheradenine Zakalwe from {{ c3 }}. This indicates
that Special Circumstances has been involved in the _War in Heaven_ since the
beginning, and makes the reader reevaluate what parts of the book were
actually part of the Culture's scheme. It's interesting to note that the
Culture often deploys Zakalwe on the side they want to lose, in this case as a
pro-hell mole on the anti-hell side.

In the previous {{ this_series }} books, I felt a slight sense of distance
from the characters and setting. For reasons I can't explain, {{ this_book }}
pulled me in and made me feel completely immersed in the world.

{{ this_book }} reminds me of several books I've read: the hacking-as-battle
scenes echo The Detective's Tail in {{ hyperion }}, the virtual hells remind
me of the Shrike and the tree of pain, and the many battles of Vatueil
reminded me of the solider traveling through time and fighting the Shrike. The
mind copies and especially Y'breq's quantum entanglement transfer reminded me
of the way Bobs create new versions in {{ bob1 }}. {{ banks }} mentions that
the dead in the galaxy outnumber the living, which harkens back to {{ so2001
}}'s line "Behind every man now alive stand thirty ghosts, for that is the
ratio by which the dead outnumber the living." The virtual hells themselves
recall the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode <cite class="show-title">Hard
time</cite> in which Chief O'Brien surfers from PTSD after being given
memories of having spent twenty years in prison.

It is bittersweet to move on to {{ c10 }}, the final Culture book. Before I do
I'm reading {{ grand_melee }}, which was just released.
