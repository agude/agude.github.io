{{ this_book }} continues the exploration of themes raised in {{ c7 }}---death
and rebirth---while diving deeper into questions of mind, consciousness,
punishment, and religion. In {{ c7 }}, the Chelgrians use soulkeepers to copy
their mind-states at death, allowing them to enter a heaven created by their
sublimed ancestors. Here, other civilizations use similar technology to trap
the unworthy dead in virtual hells, where they're tortured for eternity.

### The Plot

The large-scale plot revolves around the Culture's opposition to these virtual
hells and the simulated war---called the _War in Heaven_---over their fate.
The Culture pledged to stay out of the war to ensure fairness, but their
position grows increasingly complicated as they realize the anti-hell side is
losing.

There are multiple, intertwining small-scale plots that help keep the story
moving while giving us a broad view of the conflict. The first is the murder
of the slave Lededje Y'breq by her owner, Joiler Veppers. Y'breq is
reincarnated in the Culture from a copy of her mind-state and sets off for
revenge, eventually joining the _Abominator_-class Culture warship, _Falling
Outside The Normal Moral Constraints_ (_FOTNMC_).

The second is Veppers's involvement in the war. Initially, he appears to be a
minor player, but it quickly becomes clear that he is pivotal. He manipulates
both sides before ultimately revealing his support for the anti-hell
faction---an unexpected stance for the story's main antagonist. It's revealed
that his company supplies the hardware running most of the hells, and his
allegiance is entirely self-serving, allowing him to escape
soon-to-be-worthless contracts.

The third is the war story of virtual soldier Gyorni Vatueil as he rises
through the ranks on the anti-hell side of the _War in Heaven_. Realizing his
side is losing, he escalates the war into the real world by conspiring with
the Geseptian-Fardesile Cultural Federacy (GFCF) to launch an attack on the
hell servers.

The fourth plotline follows Prin and Chay, two Pavuleans who infiltrate their
species' hell to expose its horrors. Prin escapes, but Chay's mind is too far
gone, and she remains trapped in the hell. Through Chay's eyes, the reader is
shown exactly how terrible these simulated hells are. {{ the_authors }}
[infamous ability to write gruesome violence][wasp] brings the horror to life.

The final plotline involves Contact agent Yime Nsokyi, part of Quietus---the
branch of Contact that deals with the dead, the reincarnated, and the
simulated. She tries to intercept Y'breq but repeatedly fails. Nsokyi's role
in the narrative is mainly as an observer, offering the reader different views
of the conflict.

### Thoughts

{{ this_book }} is my favorite {{ culture }} novel so far, narrowly beating
out {{ c3 }}. This is partly because the plot is so engaging, with great
action sequences, cliffhangers, and the anticipation---shared by _FOTNMC_ in
the narrative---of seeing the Culture join in a full-scale war. But it is also
because the characters are so compelling. I wanted to see Veppers ruined and
Y'breq take her revenge. I loved the bumbling GFCF, who were just trying to
get the Culture to notice them. The psychotic but lovable _FOTNMC_ showed how
even ships can have personality. In previous Culture books, I sometimes felt a
slight detachment from the characters and settings, like I was watching them
from a distance. For reasons I can't fully explain, {{ this_book }} pulled me
in completely.

A significant twist comes in the epilogue: Vatueil is revealed to be the
Special Circumstances agent Cheradenine Zakalwe[^loser] from {{ c3 }},
implying that the Culture has been involved in the _War in Heaven_ from the
start. It forced me to reconsider what serendipitous events---like _FOTNMC_'s
arrival to pick up Y'breq---were actually Special Circumstances controlling
things in the background.

[^loser]:
    An interesting pattern emerges when you look at Zakalwe's role in both {{
    c3 }} and {{ this_book }}: he's often placed on the side the Culture wants
    to lose. In this book, he is planted as a pro-hell mole on the anti-hell
    side before eventually switching sides.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of several other works:

- The hacking-as-battle sequences echo The Detective's Tale in {{ hyperion }}.
  The virtual hells evoke the Shrike and its tree of pain. Vatueil's battles
  parallel the soldier's fight through time against the Shrike.

- Y'breq's quantum entanglement transfer recalls how the Bobs create copies in
  {{ bob1 }}.

- The mind backups are similar to the technology in {{ commonwealth }}, but
  this book explores the idea that "the backup isn't you".

- {{ banks }} notes that the galaxy's dead outnumber the living, paralleling
  {{ so2001 }}'s line: "Behind every man now alive stand thirty ghosts, for
  that is the ratio by which the dead outnumber the living."

- The virtual hells are reminiscent of the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_
  episode <cite class="tv-show-title">Hard Time</cite>, where Chief O'Brien
  suffers PTSD after receiving memories of a 20-year imprisonment.

- Virtual afterlife and themes of mind and consciousness both feature
  prominently in {{ blindsight }}.

- The mention of high-gravity species afraid of a millimeter drop recalls {{
  mission }} and {{ dragon }}.

- Although not a book, the concept of eternal punishment for mind-states
  reminds me of [Roko's basilisk][roko] and the AI safety movement.

It's bittersweet to move on to {{ c10 }}, the final Culture book. Before I do,
I'm reading {{ grand_melee }}, the latest book in the {{ war_horses }} series.
