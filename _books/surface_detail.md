{{ this_book }} continues the exploration of themes raised in {{ c7 }}---death
and rebirth---while expanding to cover the mind, consciousness, punishment,
and religion. In {{ c7 }}, the Chelgrians use soulkeepers to copy their
mind-states at death so they can be brought into a heaven created by their
sublimed ancestors. In this book, other civilizations are using similar
technology to trap the unworthy dead into virtual hells to be tortured for
eternity.

## The Plot

The large-scale plot involves the Culture's opposition to these virtual hells
and the simulated war---called the _War in Heaven_---being fought over the
fate of the hells. The Culture's position is complicated by the fact that they
pledged to stay out of the war in order for the result to be fair.

There are multiple, intertwining small-scale plots that help keep the story
moving while giving us a broad view of the conflict. The first is the murder
of the slave Lededje Y'breq by her owner, Joiler Veppers. Y'breq is
reincarnated in the Culture from a copy of her mind-state and sets off for
revenge, eventually joining the _Abominator_-class Culture warship, _Falling
Outside The Normal Moral Constraints_ (_FOTNMC_).

The second is Veppers's involvement in the war. At first, he seems to be a
minor player, but we quickly learn that he is crucial. Initially, he plots
with both sides before revealing he supports the anti-hell side, which is
unexpected due to how evil he is. We learn that his company provides the
hardware on which most of the hells run.

The third is the war story of virtual soldier Gyorni Vatueil as he rises
through the ranks on the anti-hell side of the _War in Heaven_. He realizes
that his side is losing and is pivotal in escalating the war into the real
world by conspiring with the Geseptian-Fardesile Cultural Federacy (GFCF) to
build a war fleet to attack the servers running the hells.

The fourth plotline follows Prin and Chay, two Pavuleans who infiltrate their
species' hell to expose its horrors. Prin successfully escapes, but Chay's
mind is too far gone, and she remains trapped in the hell. Through Chay's
eyes, the reader is shown exactly how terrible these simulated hells are. {{
the_authors }} infamous ability to write gruesome violence brings the horror
to life.

The final plotline involves Contact agent Yime Nsokyi, part of Quietus---the
branch of Contact that deals with the dead, the reincarnated, and the
simulated. She tries to catch Y'breq but repeatedly fails to intercept her.
Nsokyi's role in the narrative is mainly as an observer, offering the reader
different perspectives on the conflict.

## Thoughts

{{ this_book }} is my favorite {{ culture }} novel so far, narrowly beating
out {{ c3 }}. This is partly because the plot is so engaging, with great
action sequences, cliffhangers, and the anticipation---shared by _FOTNMC_ in
the narrative---of seeing the Culture join in a full-scale war. But it is also
because the characters are so compelling. I wanted to see Veppers ruined and
Y'breq take her revenge. I loved the bumbling GFCF, who were just trying to
get the Culture to notice them. And the psychotic but lovable _FOTNMC_ showed
how even ships can have personality. In previous {{ this_series }} books, I
sometimes felt a slight detachment from the characters and settings, like I
was watching them from a distance. For reasons I can't fully explain, {{
this_book }} pulled me in completely.

A significant twist comes in the epilogue: Vatueil is revealed to be the
Special Circumstances agent Cheradenine Zakalwe[^loser] from {{ c3 }},
implying that the Culture has been involved in the _War in Heaven_ from the
start. It forced me to reconsider what serendipitous events---like _FOTNMC_'s
arrival to pick up Y'breq---were actually Special Circumstances controlling
things in the background.

[^loser]: 
    An interesting pattern emerges when you look at Zakalwe's role in both {{
    c3 }} and {{ this_book }}: he is often placed on the side the Culture
    wants to lose. In this book, he is planted as a pro-hell mole on the
    anti-hell side before eventually switching sides.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of several other books:

- The hacking-as-battle scenes echo The Detective's Tale in {{ hyperion }};
  the virtual hells recall the Shrike and its tree of pain, and the many
  battles involving Vatueil are similar to the soldier traveling through time
  to fight the Shrike repeatedly.

- Y'breq's quantum entanglement transfer brought to mind how the Bobs create
  new versions in {{ bob1 }}.

- {{ banks }} notes that the galaxy's dead outnumber the living, paralleling
  {{ so2001 }}'s line: "Behind every man now alive stand thirty ghosts, for
  that is the ratio by which the dead outnumber the living."

- The virtual hells are reminiscent of the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_
  episode <cite class="tv-show-title">Hard Time</cite>, where Chief O'Brien
  suffers PTSD after receiving memories of a 20-year imprisonment.

- {{ blindsight }} features both a virtual afterlife and explores themes of
  minds and consciousness.

- The mention of high-gravity species afraid of a centimeter drop recalls {{
  mission }} and {{ dragon }}.

- Although not a book, the concept of eternal punishment for your mind-state
  reminds me of [Roko's basilisk][roko] and the AI safety movement.

It's bittersweet to move on to {{ c10 }}, the final Culture book. Before I do,
I'm reading {{ grand_melee }}, the fifth book in the {{ war_horses }} series,
which was just released.
