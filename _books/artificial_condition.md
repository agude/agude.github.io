<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span

<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span>. It follows Murderbot as it
digs into its past and, once again, saves some scientists.

{{ this_book }} moves faster than {{ mb1 }}, with a smoother blend of action
and exposition. Murderbot arrives at a mining station, gets hired as a
security consultant by a group of researchers looking to get their stolen work
back, saves their lives twice, investigates the massacre it thinks it might
have caused, saves the researchers again, and kills the bad guy. Along the way
it makes friends with a super-intelligent, super-bored, asshole research
transport (ART).

I like how {{ the_authors_lastname }} is slowly expanding the universe of {{
this_series }}. It lets her balance worldbuilding with plot, and avoids the
problem where exploring the setting is what drives the excitement in book one
but is all played out by the sequel---a trap that both {{ drop }} and {{ city
}} fell into.

One of the things I loved about this book was how Murderbot was extremely
competent. He beat the bad guys because he was just better at security and
violence then they were. It's the same enjoyment I get reading {{ ludlums }}
{{ bourne }}. The other thing I loved was ART, who was both hyper competent
and a little naive; a perfect friendly foil for Murderbot.

I really loved {{ this_book }}, even more than {{ mb1 }}, because of the
pacing, the character dynamics, and ART. I'm starting {{ mb3 }} right away!
