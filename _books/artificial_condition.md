{{ this_book }} moves faster than {{ mb1 }}, with a smoother blend of action
and exposition. Murderbot arrives at a mining station, gets hired as a
security consultant by a group of researchers trying to recover their stolen
work, saves their lives twice, investigates the massacre it thinks it might
have caused, saves the researchers again, and kills the bad guy. Along the
way, it makes friends with a super-intelligent, super-bored, asshole research
transport (ART).

I like how {{ the_authors_lastname }} is slowly expanding the universe of {{
this_series }}. It lets her balance worldbuilding with plot and avoids the
problem where exploring the setting drives the excitement in book one but
feels played out by the sequel---a trap that both {{ drop }} and {{ city }}
fell into.

A theme of {{ this_series }} is identity and purpose. Murderbot is slowly
realizing that its need to protect people isn't leftover programming but a
core part of who it is. There's a scene where ART proposes surgically
modifying Murderbot to help it stay hidden, and Murderbot instinctively
rejects it. To it, changing itself feels like losing part of what makes it
*it*. In the end, though, Murderbot accepts the alteration as necessary to
remain free.

This question of "what makes the self" is a common theme in sci-fi, one we've
seen explored in {{ blindsight }} and {{ echopraxia }}, in {{ memory }} and {{
peace }}, again in {{ weapons }}, {{ windward }}, and {{ surface }}, and of
course in {{ bob1 }}.

One of the things I enjoyed about this book was how competent Murderbot is. He
beats the bad guys because he's just better at security and violence than they
are. It was never a fair fight. It gives me the same thrill as {{ ludlums }}
{{ bourne }}. The other standout is ART, who's both hyper-competent and a
little naive---a perfect, friendly foil for Murderbot.

{{ this_book }} was great, even better than {{ mb1 }}, because of the pacing,
the character dynamics, and ART. I'm starting {{ mb3 }} right away!
