<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is the first book in the
long-running <span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series of
military science fiction. It introduces Commander Honor Harrington, a
brilliant naval officer exiled to a remote star system with an aging ship and
a demoralized crew. There, she must enforce the law and uncover a smuggling
plot that proves to be the opening move in an interstellar war.

{{ the_authors }} {{ this_series_link }} is an age of sails adventure series
like {{ obrians }} {{ aubrey_maturin_series }} or {{ foresters }} {{
hornblower_saga }}. It follows Honor Harrington as she climbs the ranks of the
Royal Manticoran Navy, which is essentially the Royal Navy with rocket
boosters attached. {{ the_authors_lastname_possessive }} solution to "How do I
get Napoleonic battle lines in space?" is part of what makes that translation
work so well. Gravity sails on the front of ships that can't be shot through,
forcing broadsides. Add in wormholes to provide choke points,
faster-than-light travel impacted by gravity to act like shallows and
currents, and you have Lord Nelson, but in the void.

The world building uses familiar ideas I've seen in other works. The wormholes
that connect Empires is something we've seen in {{ martines }} {{ teixcalaan
}} series and {{ hamiltons }} {{ commonwealth_saga }}. The Marines, who can be
dropped from orbit and bounce around in their flying power armor, remind me of
the Mobile Infantry in {{ starship_troopers }}. The Reagan Democrat politics
{{ the_authors_lastname }} includes in {{ this_book }} ages it in the same way
that {{ williamss }} [Third Way][third_way] politics in {{ city_on_fire }}
does.

{{ this_book }} is best when it focuses on process: Harrington forging her
officers and ratings into a cohesive crew, methodically planning how to meet
their impossible demands, and pursuing every lead to uncover the smugglers and
their deeper conspiracy. It made clear to me that the lack of competency in {{
tchaikovskys }} similar {{ final_architecture }} was part of the reason I
didn't like it very much. In sci-fi, military crews are competent and
duty-bound while civilians are friendly and cosy, but not particularly good at
their jobs---in fact, that's often part of the appeal. It's part of the
reason, I now realize, why I've always liked {{ tng }} and {{ ds9 }} more than
{{ sw }}.

Competency---the fantasy that there is someone out there who knows what to do
and has the will to get it done---has a strong appeal these days with the rise
of the incompetent far right. It's why I love thrillers like {{ clancys }} {{
ryanverse }} and {{ ludlums }} {{ bourne_identity }}, as well as sci-fi
versions like {{ wellss }} {{ murderbot_diaries }} and {{ alexs }} {{
mote_in_shadow }}.

But it's clear {{ the_authors_lastname }} is still learning his craft in this
book. I know from his short stories in {{ bolo12 }} and {{ bolo13 }} that he
can write some fantastic, emotional action set pieces, but he didn't in {{
this_book }}. There was action, of course, but it was either quite short---as
in the initial fleet trials---or too long---as in the final desperate chase.
In the end, Honor predicted her enemy's exact plan, but still got her ship
blown half to hell. The emotional impact was supposed to come from the loss of
ship and crew, but it felt more like Harrington had made a mistake. Not really
the epitome of competence she is supposed to be.

This book was a fast, fun read that I breezed through, just like {{ bobiverse
}} or {{ warhorses }}. I'm still trying to avoid reading long series
back-to-back, so I'm going to get through {{ canticle }} first, and probably
back to {{ bolo }} and {{ hyperion2 }} before I read {{ hh2 }}.
