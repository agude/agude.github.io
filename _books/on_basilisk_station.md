<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is the first book in the
long-running <span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series of
military science fiction. It introduces Commander Honor Harrington, a
brilliant naval officer exiled to a remote star system with an aging ship and
a demoralized crew. There, she must enforce the law and uncover a smuggling
plot that turns out to be the opening move in an interstellar war.

{{ the_authors }} {{ this_series_link }} is an age-of-sail adventure series
like {{ obrians }} {{ aubrey_maturin_series }} or {{ foresters }} {{
hornblower_saga }}. It follows Honor Harrington as she climbs the ranks of the
Royal Manticoran Navy, which is essentially the Royal Navy with rocket
boosters attached. {{ the_authors_lastname_possessive }} answer to "How do I
get Napoleonic battle lines in space?" is part of what makes that translation
work so well. Ships have gravity sails that can't be fired through from the
front, forcing broadside engagements. Add wormholes to create choke points and
faster-than-light travel affected by gravity to act like shallows and
currents, and you have Lord Nelson, but in the void.

The worldbuilding uses ideas I've seen in other series. Wormhole-connected
empires show up again in {{ martines }} {{ teixcalaan }} books and {{
hamiltons }} {{ commonwealth_saga }}. The Marines, who can drop from orbit and
bounce around in powered armor, recall the Mobile Infantry from {{
starship_troopers }}. The Reagan Democrat politics {{ the_authors_lastname }}
weaves into {{ this_book }} date it a bit, the same way that {{ williamss }}
[Third Way][third_way] politics do in {{ city_on_fire }}.

{{ this_book }} is at its best when it focuses on process: Harrington forging
her officers and ratings into a cohesive crew, methodically planning how to
meet impossible demands, and following every lead to uncover the smugglers and
their deeper conspiracy. It also made me realize that the lack of competence
is part of why I didn't like {{ tchaikovskys }} similar {{ final_architecture
}} series as much. In sci-fi, military crews are competent and duty-bound,
while civilians are friendly and cozy but not particularly good at their
jobs---in fact, that's often part of the charm. It's also part of the reason,
I now realize, why I've always preferred {{ tng }} and {{ ds9 }} over {{ sw
}}.

Competence---the fantasy that someone out there knows what to do and has the
will to do it---has a strong appeal these days, especially with the rise of
the incompetent far right. It's why I love thrillers like {{ clancys }} {{
ryanverse }} and {{ ludlums }} {{ bourne_identity }}, and sci-fi versions like
{{ wellss }} {{ murderbot_diaries }} and {{ alexs }} {{ mote_in_shadow }}.

But it's clear {{ the_authors_lastname }} was still learning his craft here. I
know from his short stories in {{ bolo12 }} and {{ bolo13 }} that he can write
fantastic, emotional action scenes, but he didn't quite pull it off in {{
this_book }}. There's plenty of action, but it's either too short---like the
initial fleet trials---or too long---like the final desperate chase. In the
end, Honor predicts her enemy's exact plan but still gets her ship blown half
to hell. The emotional impact was supposed to come from the loss of ship and
crew, but it feels more like Harrington simply made a mistake. Not exactly the
image of competence she's meant to embody.

This book was a fast, fun read that I breezed through, much like {{ bobiverse
}} or {{ warhorses }}. I'm still trying to avoid reading long series
back-to-back, so I'm going to read {{ canticle }} next, then circle back to {{
bolo }} and {{ hyperion2 }} before diving into {{ hh2 }}.
