{{ this_book }} takes place in a fictional suburb of 1970s Los Angeles. The LA
of the book is a violent place with gangs, murders, fatal traffic collisions,
and other accidental deaths. It is made deadlier by the presence of Doro and
his telepathic children, who react violently to each other. The story is told
by Doro, Emma, Mary, Karl, Seth, Rachael, Jesse, Ada, and Jan. Seth is Clay
Dana's brother, the eponymous Clay from {{ p3 }}. Mary goes through her
transition and discovers she can control and shield other telepaths, and
creates a gigantic community call the Patternists.

I did not like {{ this_book }} very much. Like {{ p1 }}, it is mainly a book
about the characters and their relationships, but there were too many
characters and I didn't care for any of them. This made the book feel empty
because there was little plot to fill in the void.

I think the biggest problem was that {{ p1 }} did such a good job building up
Doro and Anyanwu---who goes by Emma in this book---that I cared a lot about
them, and they are all but absent from this book.

The themes of othering and slavery are still present, but muted. The
Patternists enslave normal humans, and even have a slur for them. They're
clearly evil, which made it hard to root for any of them.

I would have stopped halfway through the book if it wasn't part of my book
club. I will give {{ p3 }} a go, but might not make it through.
