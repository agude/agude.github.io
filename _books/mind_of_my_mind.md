{{ this_book }} is set in a fictional suburb of 1970s Los Angeles. The LA of
the book is a violent and dangerous place, filled with gangs, murders, fatal
traffic collisions, and other accidental deaths. The danger is amplified by
the presence of Doro and his telepathic children, who react violently to one
another. The story is told from multiple perspectives, including Doro, Emma,
Mary, Karl, Seth, Rachael, Jesse, Ada, and Jan. Seth is the brother of Clay
Dana, the titular character from {{ p3 }}. In the book, Mary undergoes her
transition, discovers her ability to control and shield other telepaths, and
establishes a massive community called the Patternists.

I didn't enjoy {{ this_book }} very much. Like {{ p1 }}, it focuses mainly on
the characters and their relationships, but this time there were too many
characters, none of whom I cared about. As a result, the book felt hollow,
with little plot to fill the gaps.

The biggest issue for me was that {{ p1 }} did such a great job building up
Doro and Anyanwu---who goes by Emma in this book---that I became invested in
them, only for them to be nearly absent here. None of the new characters have
their same force of personality.

The themes of othering and slavery are still present, but muted. The
Patternists enslave normal humans and even have a slur for them. The
Patternists are clearly evil, which made it hard to root for any of them.

If it weren't for my book club, I would have stopped reading halfway through.
I'll give {{ p3 }} a try, but I'm not optimistic about finishing it.
