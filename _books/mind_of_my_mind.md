{{ this_book }} takes place in a fictional suburb of 1970s Los Angeles. The LA
of the book is a violent place with gangs, murders, fatal traffic collisions,
and other accidental deaths. It is made deadlier by the presence of Doro and
his telepathic children, who react violently to each other. The story is told
by Doro, Emma, Mary, Karl, Seth, Rachael, Jesse, Ada, and Jan. Seth is Clay
Dana's brother, the eponymous Clay from {{ p3 }}. Mary goes through her
transition and discovers she can control and shield other telepaths, and
creates a gigantic community call the Patternists.

I did not like {{ this_book }} very much. It has too many characters, few of
which I cared about. I think part of the problem was that {{ p1 }} is so
tightly written and focused on Doro and Anyanwu. It was their rivalry and
relationship that I cared about. They are all but missing from this book.
Anyanwu especially, who now goes by Emma, plays a bit part that feels
artificially small after how much of a force she was previously.

The themes of othering and slavery are still present, but muted. The
Patternists enslave normal humans, and even have a slur for them. They're
clearly evil, which made it hard to root for any of them.

I would have stopped halfway through the book if it wasn't part of my book
club. I will give {{ p3 }} a go, but might not make it through.
