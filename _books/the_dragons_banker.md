<cite class="book-title">The Dragon's Banker</cite> is a standalone novel by
Scott Warren. It tells the story of Sailor Kelstern, a banker in a fantasy
world who---as you would predict from the title---is hired by a dragon.

One of my favorite niche sub-genres of fantasy[^fate] explores the question: What if
a dragon used their intellect, riches, and magic to interact with to subtly
shape the world instead of charging in and breathing fire. {{ this_book }}
falls exactly into the sub-genere.

[^fate]:
    My longest running tabletop roleplaying game was based on this premise, so
    it is one that is near and dear to my heart.

The surface premise is this: the world is converting from [precious metal][cm]
to [fiat currency][fiat]. The dragon lord Alkarzarian is the richest being in
the world---unbeknownst to anyone---but he is worried he will lose that spot
if paper money takes off. So he sends his daughter to find a banker to help
put his hoard to work.

I think this would have been an really interesting story; and it is the story
I thought I was reading in the first part of the book. But it is not, it turns
out, what {{ this_book }} is about.

Kelstern sets up multiple different enterprises to earn the dragon money, and
they all fail. Kelstern discovers that the Dragon's second son is apparently
working against the interests of his father and causing much of the misfortune
befalling their company.

At the end, we learn the dragon and his brood were not in fact interested in
earning money, but rather wanted to use Kelstern to learn the human's economic
systems so that it could be manipulated and destroyed. But because Kelstern
was such a good person---helping the poor, looking out for his friends---the
dragon's daughter decides to give humans a shot. Unfortunately this is
revealed in the last few pages in a note explaining the whole plot, so it sort
of blunts the impact.

I enjoyed the parallels between Kelstern and the dragons. Kelstern is the
narrator and his descriptions of people always focuses on their precious
metals: gold teeth, silver embroidery, copper spectacles, platinum necklace.

Overall I was hoping Kelstern would "win" by coming up with a clever,
heist-like plan, or that the dragons would use their superior intellect to do
so, but no. In the end Kelstern wins by being upstanding, and the dragon's
plan is too simple: watch humans, and make money shorting thinks before
burning them down with dragon fire.

There is also a little bit of a weird inconstancy: the dragons' plan was to
destroy the human economic system, but they also transferred several pieces of
technology that moved the whole empire forward. I'm not sure why. Perhaps they
had a change of heart (although the plan with the dragon-eyes and water-proof
chemical, that when combined create refridgeration, was in play well before
Kelstern showed he was a good person).

In my ideal dragon story, the fact that the dragon can breath fire would make
no difference.
