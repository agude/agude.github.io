<cite class="book-title">The Dragon's Banker</cite> is a standalone novel by
Scott Warren. It tells the story of Sailor Kelstern, a banker in a fantasy
world who, as the title suggests, is hired by a dragon.

One of my favorite niche sub-genres of fantasy[^fate] explores the question:
What if a dragon used their intellect, riches, and magic to subtly shape the
world instead of charging in and breathing fire. I thought {{ this_book }}
fell squarely into this sub-genre.

[^fate]:
    My longest running tabletop roleplaying game was based on this premise, so
    it is one that is near and dear to my heart.

The surface premise is this: the world is transitioning from [precious
metal][cm] to [fiat currency][fiat]. The dragon lord Alkarzarian, unbeknownst
to anyone, is the richest being in the world, but he is worried he will lose
that spot if paper money takes off. So he sends his daughter, Arkelai, to find
a banker to help put his hoard to work.

I think this would have been an really interesting story, and it is the story
I thought I was reading in the first part of the book. However, that is not
what {{ this_book }} is about.

At the end, it is revealed in a note from Arkelai that they chose Kelstern
because they thought he was as greedy as a dragon, and assumed he would wage
economic war against the other banks and merchants when they bankrolled him,
allowing the dragons to swoop in and pick up the pieces. But Kelstern is too
honorable: taking care of his employees, treating people with respect, and
paying taxes on his ventures.

So the dragons try to provoke him into conflict. The Alkarzarian's son
intervenes and turns the other merchants against Kelstern, ensuring all his
enterprises fail. Yet Kelstern persists, causing Arkelai to realized she
couldn't continue to betray the honorable banker. Luckily, she had learned
about [short-selling][short] from Kelstern, and so the dragons changed their
plan. They take a large short position in many different companies, and then
burn them to the ground.

I enjoyed the parallels between Kelstern and the dragons. Kelstern is the
narrator, and his descriptions of people always focus on their precious
metals: gold teeth, silver embroidery, copper spectacles, platinum necklace.

Overall, I was hoping Kelstern would "win" by coming up with a clever,
heist-like plan, or that the dragons would use their superior intellect to do
so. Instead, the dragon's plan became too simple: make money by shorting
things before burning them down with dragon fire.

There is also a slight inconsistency: the dragons's plan was to profit off the
human economic system, but they also transferred several pieces of technology
that moved the whole empire forward, like fuel-free heat, new ship designs,
and refrigeration. Perhaps the dragons's real motivation was to move humanity
forward? But if so their other behavior seems to misanthropic for that.

While a fun read, the story is far from perfect. In my ideal dragon story, the
fact that the dragon can breathe fire would make no difference and in this one
it was vital.
