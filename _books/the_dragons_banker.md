<cite class="book-title">The Dragon's Banker</cite> is a standalone novel by
Scott Warren. It tells the story of Sailor Kelstern, a banker in a fantasy
world who---as you would predict from the title---is hired by a dragon.

One of my favorite niche sub-genres of fantasy[^fate] explores the question: What if
a dragon used their intellect, riches, and magic to interact with to subtly
shape the world instead of charging in and breathing fire. {{ this_book }}
falls exactly into the sub-genere.

[^fate]:
    My longest running tabletop roleplaying game was based on this premise, so
    it is one that is near and dear to my heart.

The surface premise is this: the world is converting from [precious metal][cm]
to [fiat currency][fiat]. The dragon lord Alkarzarian is the richest being in
the world---unbeknownst to anyone---but he is worried he will lose that spot
if paper money takes off. So he sends his daughter to find a banker to help
put his hoard to work.

I think this would have been an really interesting story; and it is the story
I thought I was reading in the first part of the book. But it is not, it turns
out, what {{ this_book }} is about.

Kelstern sets up multiple different enterprises to earn the dragon money, and
they all fail. Kelstern discovers that the Dragon's second son is apparently
working against the interests of his father and causing much of the misfortune
befalling their company. Every endevour Kelstern embarks on comes to ruin.

At the end it is revealed (in a note from Arkelai, the dragon's daughter and
Kelstern's handler) that they picked Kelstern because they thought he was as
greedy as a dragon, and assumed he would wage economic war against the other
banks and merchants when they bankrolled him. But Kelstern was
honorable---taking care of his employees, treating people with respect, paying
taxes---and so they tried to provoke him into conflict. When this also failed,
Arkelai realized she couldn't continue to betray the banker. Luckily, she had
learned about [short-selling][short] from Kelstern, and so the dragons changed
their plan to taking a large short position in many different companies, and
then burning them to the ground.

I enjoyed the parallels between Kelstern and the dragons. Kelstern is the
narrator and his descriptions of people always focuses on their precious
metals: gold teeth, silver embroidery, copper spectacles, platinum necklace.

Overall I was hoping Kelstern would "win" by coming up with a clever,
heist-like plan, or that the dragons would use their superior intellect to do
so, but no. In the end the dragon's plan becomes too simple: make money by
shorting things before burning them down with dragon fire.

There is also a little bit of a weird inconstancy: the dragons' plan was to
profit off the human economic system, but they also transferred several pieces of
technology that moved the whole empire forward, like fuel free heat, new ship
designs, and refrigeration. I'm not sure why.

A fun read, but far from perfect. In my ideal dragon story, the fact that the
dragon can breath fire would make no difference.
