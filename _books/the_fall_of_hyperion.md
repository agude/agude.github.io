<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a sequel that outshines
its predecessor. It is everything I was expecting from {% book_link "Hyperion" %} and more! A true masterpiece.

The book picks up right where {{ hyperion }} left off with the pilgrims
arriving at the Time Tombs. But the book also follows several characters out
in the wider Hegemony, which gives the story a much broader feel: we aren't
confined to one planet anymore.

{{ this_book }} is a more straightforward story than {{ hyperion }}. It's one
storyline, not six, and it progresses linearly starting at the beginning and
finishing at the end.

The story is simple: the Ousters---a barbarian group of humans who travel the
outreaches of space looking for systems to pillage---are invading the Hyperion
system and the Hegemony must stop them. What initially seems like a military
campaign to boost the CEO's election chances quickly becomes a disaster as the
Ousters are more numerous and more capable than anticipated.

The stakes of the action shift multiple times:

- When we learn of an Ouster counterattack against multiple different
  worlds---attacks that had to have been launched a century early because of
  the vast distances they had to travel.

- When we discover that the Ousters are not the barbarians we'd been led to
  believe them to be, but are enlightened humanists, possibly even more worthy
  of the mantle of humanity than the Hegemony.

- When we discover the other attackers are not the Ousters, but TechnoCore
  fleets launched far in the past in anticipation of manipulating the Hegemony
  into an unwinnable war.

The book answers all of the questions opened in the first, and the ending is
satisfying.
