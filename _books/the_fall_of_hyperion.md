<cite class="book-title">The Fall of Hyperion</cite> is a sequel that
outshines it's predecessor. It is everything I was expecting from {% include
book_link.html title="Hyperion" %} and more! A true masterpiece.

The book picks up right where {% include book_link.html title="Hyperion" %}
left off with the pilgrims arriving at the Time Tombs. But the book also
follows several characters out in the wider Hegemony, which gives the story a
much broader feel: we aren't confined to one planet anymore.

<cite class="book-title">The Fall of Hyperion</cite> is a more straightforward
story than {% include book_link.html title="Hyperion" %}. It's one storyline,
not six, and it progresses linearly starting at the beginning and finishing at
the end.

The story is simple: the Ousters---a barbarian group of humans who travel the
outreaches of space looking for systems to pillage---are invading the
Hyperion system and the Hegemony must stop them. What initially seems like a
military campaign to boost the CEO's election chances quickly becomes a
disaster as the Ousters are more numerous and more capable than anticipated.

The stakes of the action shift multiple times:

- When we learn of an Ouster counter attack against multiple different
  worlds---attacks that had to have been launched a century early because of
  the vast distances they had to travel.
- When we discover that the Ousters are not the barbarians we'd been
  led to believe them to be, but are enlightened humanists, possibly even more
  worthy of the mantel of humanity than the Hegemony.
- When we discover the other attackers are not the Ousters, but
  TechnoCore fleets launched far in the past in anticipation of manipulating
  the Hegemony into an unwinnable war.

The book answers all of the questions opened in the first, and the ending is
satisfying.
