<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the sixth book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It's Martin's
origin story, following him as he's enslaved by---and eventually leads an
uprising against---the tyrant Badrang.

{{ this_book }} has two villains: Badrang the Tyrant and the corsair Tramun
Clogg. For much of the story, they have an on-again, off-again rivalry, with
intertwining schemes and betrayals, before Badrang finally gains the upper
hand. This leads to a first in the {{ series }}: Clogg actually survives the
book!

The story follows Martin as he's captured, escapes, travels to Noonvale, and
then returns at the head of an army to kill Badrang. The banter and
double-crossing between the villains are fun, but the quest to Noonvale feels
like a side plot that drags on too long. Martin and his new love, Rose, run
into half a dozen different groups along the way, but none of them leave much
of an impression because their parts are so brief.

There's also an awkward moment near the end where {{ the_author }} seems to
realize he's written himself into a corner, and has Martin proclaim, "I will
never mention Noonvale, or any of you," as a way to explain why Martin's story
in {{ this_book }} differs from the one told in {{ redwall }} or {{ mossflower
}}. Until that moment, it hadn't felt odd that Martin---more legend than
living creature in the series---had a vague past, but calling attention to it
made the gap feel unnatural.

Overall, {{ this_book }} was a little disappointing after the fantastic {{
salamandastron }}. I'm not sure how much further we'll get in the series as my
kids are starting to want to read their own books instead of listening to Dad.
I'm proud of the readers they're becoming, but a little sad that it means
story time is near its end.

In truth, I think their disinterest affected how much I enjoyed the book too.
But still, we'll give {{ bellmaker }} a try, even if it ends up being the
last.
