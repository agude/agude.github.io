{{ this_book }} has two villains: Badrang the Tyrant and the corsair Tramun
Clogg. For much of the book, they have an on-again, off-again relationship
with various intertwining schemes and backstabbings before Badrang gets the
upper hand. This leads to a first in the {{ series }}: a villain who survives
the book!

The book follows Martin as he is captured, escapes, travels to Noonvale, and
then returns at the head of an army to kill Badrang. The bantering and
backstabbing between the villains are fun, but the quest to Noonvale feels
more like a side plot that is drawn out too long. Martin and his new-love Rose
run into half a dozen different groups of people on their quest, but none of
them make an impression because of how short their parts are. There is also an
inelegant section at the end where {{ the_author }} realizes he's written
himself into a corner and has Martin proclaim "I will never mention Noonvale,
or any of you." as a way to explain how none of the key moments in his life
were mentioned in {{ redwall }} or {{ mossflower }}.

Overall, a little disappointing after the fantastic {{ salamandastron }}. I'm
not sure how much further we'll get in the series, because my kids are
starting to want to read their own books instead of listening to Dad. I'm
proud of the readers they're becoming, but sad that it means story time is
near its end.

In truth, I think part of their disinterest negatively effected my own
enjoyment of the book. But still, we'll give {{ bellmaker }} a try, although
it might be the last.
