The final book in Hamilton's Void Trilogy, <span class="book-title">The
Evolutionary Void</span>, finishes off the story a little too quickly. The
ending feels rushed.

At the end of {% include book_link.html title="The Temporal Void" %}, Edeard
learns he can reset his world within the Void to a point in the past of his
choosing, allowing him to learn from his mistakes. In <span class="book-title">The
Evolutionary Void</span>, Edeard puts these power to use attempting to
perfecting the timeline.

Edeard brings a time of peace and harmony to his city, but he
soon begins to run into other psychics even more powerful than himself and
without Edeard's moral principles. Edeard is forced to take more and more
drastic actions, including preventing one of the psychics from being born. His
actions change his personality, alienating his friends and family, and finally
convincing him that he must use his own mental powers to dominate the
citizenry in order to bring order. These chapters are tough to read because,
after two books, I had grown attached to Edeard, the hero who never faltered.

Of course, true to his role as the perfect Hero, Edeard realizes his mistakes
and undoes them, living a final, perfect life.

Outside the void is a little more chaotic, but the various storylines start to
weave together until, suddenly, they are all in the right places and save the
universe. It feels about as abrupt as that sentence when reading the book.

Still, there are some satisfying moments, like when Qutax gets revenge against
The Cat[^adama], and all the mysteries of Edeard's city are revealed.

All and all, the series does not quite meet the expectations set by {% include
book_link.html title="The Dreaming Void" %}, but is still good fun.

[^adama]:
    With a "Reverse Adama Maneuver", raising the High Angel out of a gas
    giant's atmosphere to ambush The Cat's ship.
