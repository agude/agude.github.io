The final book in <span class="author-name">Hamilton</span>'s <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span>, <cite class="book-title">{{
page.title }}</cite>, wraps up the series well, but a little too quickly. All
the characters and storylines arrive where they're needed and then the story
is over.

At the end of {{ temporal_void }}, Edeard learns that he can rewind his world
to a point of his choosing to get a second (or third, or fourth, ...) chance
to do things right. In {{ this_book }}, Edeard uses this power to try to make
his world perfect.

Edeard brings peace to his city, for a time. Soon he runs into other psychics
with powers even greater than his own. Edeard is forced to take more and more
drastic measures, including stopping one of them from being born, and his
actions weigh heavily on him. This burden alienates him from his friends and
family, and leads to him become the same despot he overthrew earlier. These
chapters are tough to read because, after two books, I had grown attached to
Edeard, the hero who never faltered.

Of course, true to his role as the perfect hero, Edeard realizes his mistakes
and undoes them, living a final, flawless life.

Outside the void is a little more chaotic, but the various storylines start to
weave together until, suddenly, they are all in the right places and save the
universe. I did not predict the ending this time, unlike for {{
judas_unchained }}, but in a way that is why it felt abrupt: it was
foreshadowed but more subtly. Still, there are some satisfying moments, like
when Qutax gets revenge against The Cat[^adama], and when all the mysteries of
Edeard's city are revealed.

All in all, the series does not quite meet the expectations set by {{
dreaming_void }}, but is still good fun.

[^adama]:
    With a "Reverse Adama Maneuver", raising the High Angel out of a gas
    giant's atmosphere to ambush The Cat's ship.
