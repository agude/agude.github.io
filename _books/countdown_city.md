Bret has run away from his wife Martha on a crusade to stop atrocities the US
government is committing against refugees. Detective Palace pursues and finds
him, only for Bret to be murdered by a man in love with Martha who doesn't
want Bret to return. When Palace gets back to Concord, he discovers Martha has
disappeared as well. This mystery is weaker than in {{ lpm1 }}, and the
resolution---that Martha has run away with her father---is a letdown. I
expected something cleverer, and it felt disappointingly simple.

The Nico-saves-the-world storyline continues, with her appearing in a
helicopter, a literal [_machina_][dem], to rescue Palace after he and Bret are
shot. At this point in the story, there isn't even running water or
electricity, so a helicopter seems fantastical. It makes me even more
concerned that Nico and her group are actually going to save the world, which
would undermine the feeling of hopelessness these books have carefully built.

One thing I liked about the book is that we get to see more of the world and
explore how far it has fallen since {{ lpm1 }}. The Coast Guard is machine-gunning
children on refugee ships, the police are barely more than a gang, and power
and water have been cut off, leading former neighbors to kill each other over
supplies. I also loved the snippets about the Mayfair Commission, where
Congress was pointlessly hauling former NASA directors in for questioning
about how they could have missed the asteroid. Even with the world ending, the
bureaucracy continues.

However, the flashbacks, my favorite parts of the first book, are mostly gone.
We see the world as it is but lose out on learning how it got to be that way.

Overall, it's an OK book that relies on its quick pacing. I hope my worst fears
of the world being miraculously saved and the tension being ruined don't come
to pass in {{ lpm3 }}, which I'm reading next.
