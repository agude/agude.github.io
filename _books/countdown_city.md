Bret has run away from his wife Martha on a crusade to stop the Coast Guard
from machine gunning refugees. Detective Palace pursues and finds him, only
for Bret to be murdered by a man in love with Martha, who doesn't want Bret to
come back. When Palace returns to Concord, Martha has disappeared as well.
This mystery is weaker than in {{ lpm1 }}, and the resolution---that Martha
has run away with her father---is a letdown: I expected something clever, and
it didn't feel clever at all.

The Nico storyline continues, with Nico showing up [_Deus ex Machina_][dem] on
a helicopter after Palace and Bret are shot. Not only did the helicopter come
out of nowhere, but it makes me even more worried that Nico and her cohort are
actually going to save the world, would ruin the feeling these books have
cultivated.

[dem]: <!-- TODO: Deus Ex Machina -->

A good part about the book is we get to see more of the world, and explore how
far it has fallen since {{ lpm1 }}: the Coast Guard is machine gunning
children on refugee ships, the police are barely more than a gang, power and
water have been cut off and so former neighbors are now killing each other
over supplies. However the flashbacks, my favorite parts of the first book,
are gone; we see the world as it is but lose out on learning how it got to be
that way.

Overall an OK book that lives on its quick pacing. I hope my worst fears of a
miraculous asteroid deflection and ruined tension don't come to pass in {{
lpm3 }}, which I'm reading next.
