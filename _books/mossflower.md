<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in the
Redwall series. It chronicles the arrival of Martin the Warrior in Mossflower
woods and how he saves the woodlanders from the evil wildcat queen Tsarmina.

{% capture this_book %}<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>{% endcapture %}

The structure of the story mirrors {% include book_link.html title="Redwall"
%} in many ways:

- Like Mathias, Martin has to go on a quest to get his sword.

- The woodlanders are under threat from an evil leader and their army,
  although in {{ this_book }} Tsarmina has her own castle, Kotir, which the
  woodlanders besiege, whereas Cluny and his army attack Redwall.

The plot is is simple---Tsarmina is oppressing the woodlanders and Martin can
save them if he finds Boar the fighter---and the characters are mostly black
and white, with two exceptions: snakefish, a predator who none-the-less helps
Martin; and Ashleg, an advisor to Tsarmina who has a change of heart and runs
off to start a new life.

The highlight of the book was seeing Salamandastron for the first time and
meeting Boar the fighter and his hares. The badger lords and their long patrol
were always my favorite parts of the books when I was younger.

Again my children loved {{ this_book }}, and we moved right on to the next
book in the series, {% include book_link.html title="Mattimeo" %}, the same
night we finished {{ this_book }}.
