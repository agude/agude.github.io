<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in the
Redwall series. It chronicles the arrival of Martin the Warrior in Mossflower
Woods and how he saves the woodlanders from the evil wildcat queen, Tsarmina.

{% capture this_book %}<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>{% endcapture %}

The structure of the story mirrors {% include book_link.html title="Redwall"
%} in several ways:

- Like Mathias, Martin has to go on a quest to get his sword.

- The woodlanders are threatened by an evil leader and their army. In {{
  this_book }}, Tsarmina has her own castle, Kotir, which the woodlanders
  besiege, whereas Cluny and his army attack Redwall.

The plot is is simple: Tsarmina is oppressing the woodlanders, and Martin can
save them if he finds Boar the fighter. The characters are mostly black and
white, with two exceptions: snakefish, a predator who nonetheless helps
Martin; and Ashleg, an advisor to Tsarmina who has a change of heart and runs
off to start a new life.

The highlight of the book was the introduction of Salamandastron and the
meeting with Boar the Fighter and his hares. The badger lords and their Long
Patrol were always a favorite part of the series for me when I was younger.

My children also enjoyed {{ this_book }}, and we moved straight on to the next
book in the series, {% include book_link.html title="Mattimeo" %}.
