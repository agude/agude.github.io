<span class="book-title">The Quantum Thief</span> is a sci-fi novel that
follows the adventures of the gentleman thief Jean le Flambeur.

The story follows Jean le Flambeur, an exceptional thief, who is broken out of
prison by a god-like, uploaded-intelligence to steal some unspecified thing of
great value. But there is a problem: le Flambeur wiped his own mind and hid
his memories before he was captured. If he is going to pull off a heist, first
he has to get them back.

Le Flambeur and his handler head to Mars to recover his memory. They quickly
get entangled with local affairs and end up starting a revolution to free the
Oubliette---a walking city where all memories encrypted and stored on the
local internet, allowing people to precisely control what others can remember
about them.

The world building is exceptional! There are so many new and exciting ideas in
the book! The walking city that must keep moving to avoid the grey goo
machines trying to destroy it. The life and death cycle of citizens who spend
part of their time living normally and part of the time enslaved to perform
maintenance on the city. And using time---the time your have before you are
enslaved---as a currency for everything.

And there are so many mysteries! Who is le Flambeur and what did he do to be
thrown in prison? What is his relation to all the people on Mars? What is so
important that he is the one who can steal it? Why do the people of the
Oubliette accept the horrible bargain of being enslaved half their endless
lives?

The problem is: I didn't care. Shocking twist after shocking twist didn't
phase me because I didn't identify with any of the characters. At several
points during the book I put it down and realized that I had no desire to find
out how it ended. It only finished it by making myself pick up the book and
flip through a few more pages.

In the end, a wonderful backdrop with thin story on top.
