{{ this_book }} is the first {{ redwall_series }} book with a female lead. In
general, the series is quite inclusive in terms of gender roles, with female
characters filling various traditionally male-dominated roles from warrior to
leader to villain. Other forms of diversity aren't as well represented---there
are no LGBTQ characters, for example---and there is an inherent "species-ism"
in that mice are good while rats are bad. {{ the_author }} does start to
subvert this with various reformed vermin later in the series, like Blaggut in
{{ bellmaker }}.

Gabool is an interesting villain as he is the most hands-off antagonist to date. He
torments Mariel and Joseph at the beginning of the book, but after throwing
them into the sea, he doesn't interact directly with the woodlanders, instead
directing his searats from the safety of his island fortress. Still, we
develop a hatred for him due to how he mistreats all the creatures---friends
and foes alike---that he encounters.

{{ this_book }} also features the first scenes of the Long Patrol hares and the
Badger lord in combat, which is satisfying after their reputations as warriors
were built up over the past few books.

Another great book that my kids loved; we're starting {{ salamandstron }}
next.
