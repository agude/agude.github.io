{{ this_book }} is the first {{ Redwall }} book with a female lead. In
generally the series is pretty inclusive in terms of gender roles, with women
filling various male-dominated roles from warrior to leader to villain. Other
forms of diversity aren't as well represented---there are no LGBTQ
characters for example---and there is an inherent "species-ism" in that mice
are good, rats are bad. {{ the_author }} does start to subvert this with
various reformed vermin later in the series, like Blaggut in {{ bellmaker }}.

Gabool is an interesting villain as he is the most hands-off one to date. He
torments Mariel and Joseph at the beginning of the book, but after that only
interacts with his searat crew.

{{ this_book }} also has the first scenes of the Long Patrol hares and the
Badger lord fighting, which is satisfying after their reputations as warriors
was built up over the past few books.
