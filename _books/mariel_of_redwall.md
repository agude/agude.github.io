{{ this_book }} is the first {{ redwall_series }} book with a female lead. In
generally the series is pretty inclusive in terms of gender roles, with women
filling various male-dominated roles from warrior to leader to villain. Other
forms of diversity aren't as well represented---there are no LGBTQ characters
for example---and there is an inherent "species-ism" in that mice are good,
rats are bad. {{ the_author }} does start to subvert this with various
reformed vermin later in the series, like Blaggut in {{ bellmaker }}.

Gabool is an interesting villain as he is the most hands-off one to date. He
torments Mariel and Joseph at the beginning of the book, but after throwing
them into the sea he doesn't interact directly with the woodlanders, instead
directing his searats from the safety of his island fortress. Still, we
develope a hatred of him due to how he treats all the creatures---friends or
foes---that he meets.

{{ this_book }} also has the first scenes of the Long Patrol hares and the
Badger lord fighting, which is satisfying after their reputations as warriors
was built up over the past few books.

Another great book that my kids loved, we're starting {{ salamandstron }}
next.
