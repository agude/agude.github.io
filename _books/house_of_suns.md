<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a stand-alone hard sci-fi
book by {{ page.book_author }}. It tells the story of the Gentian Line, a
family of clones who are betrayed, nearly wiped out, and must piece together
what happened.

A chapter into {{ this_book }}, it reminded me of {{ quantum }}, and not in a
good way: a fantastically well designed world filled with flat characters. It
only got worse from there.

The writing is bad. At several points I put the book down, stared at the
ceiling, and thought "An award-winning author wrote that..." after reading a
particularly bad paragraph or stretch of dialog. The pacing is also uneven,
with long boring stretches. A good editor could have salvaged the story by
cutting 200 pages.

The characters, almost all of them clones, might as well be the same. And that
wasn't the author's intent. Flat doesn't do their lack of dimension justice.
They are points, not even 1D. The two main characters---Campion and
Purslane---alternate narration but are so similar I could only tell whose
chapter it was when the other one walked into view.

The most interesting thing the book attempts is setting up a sci-fi universe
where the speed of light is (almost) absolute. Travel and communication takes
a long time. Civilizations rise and fall while people are in transit.
Actuarial estimates are used to predict if the place your going will even be
there in 50 thousand years. I thought this was a great concept to explore, but
{{ this_book }} squandered it.

Because the story is a simple [whodunit][who] that takes place mostly on one
planet, it didn't need the universe. It didn't need to and did not explore the
implications of deep time. Instead all the time that passed as the ships flew
around felt like a diligent physics student answering question on a final.
_"If a ship accelerates smoothly to 0.9c and then accelerates back to 0 over a
10,000ly trip, what amount of time passes for a) and outside observer, b) for
the crew of the ship?"_ Who cares!

Like much of modern sci-fi, {{ this_book }} pays homage to {{ wolfe }} series
{{ botns }}. The Curators are a direct homage to the Megatherians: they
achieve immortality through constant physical growth, must live in fluid
because of their size, and have vast knowledge. The planet Neume has a giant
skull mountain reminiscent of Typhon's mountain. The main city is Ymir,
sharing a name with another of character from {{ botns }}---also referencing
the giant whose body became the world in Norse mythology, just like the city
is built on a giant stone hand.

In all, a disappointing start, but if Reynolds can fix his writing, I may
enjoy his next books.
