<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a standalone hard sci-fi
book by {{ page.book_author }}. It tells the story of the Gentian Line, a
family of clones who are betrayed, nearly wiped out, and must unravel what
happened.

A chapter into {{ this_book }}, it reminded me of {{ quantum }}, and not in a
good way: a fantastically well-designed world filled with flat characters. It
only got worse from there.

The writing is weak. Several times, after particularly bad paragraphs or
stretches of dialogue, I put the book down, stared at the ceiling, and thought
"An award-winning author wrote that..." The pacing is also uneven, with long,
boring stretches. A skilled editor could have salvaged the story by cutting
around 200 pages.

The characters were flat, and although they were mostly clones, I don't
believe it was the author's intent to make them identical. But flat doesn't do
justice to their lack of dimension; they are mere points, not even
one-dimensional. The two main characters---Campion and Purslane---alternate
narration, but they are so similar that I could only tell whose chapter it was
when the other one appeared.

The most interesting thing the book attempts is setting up a sci-fi universe
where the speed of light is (almost) absolute.[^c] Travel and communication
take a long time. Civilizations rise and fall while people are in transit.
Actuarial estimates are used to predict if the destination will even exist in
50,000 years. I thought this was an excellent concept to explore, but {{
this_book }} squandered it.

[^c]:
    At the very end of the book, faster-than-light travel is becomes possible,
    but Reynolds ivnets a clever soltuion to preserve causality. That is one
    thing I can't fault: the science is impecible, as you would expect form
    and astronomer.

Because the story is a simple [whodunit][who] that takes place mostly on one
planet, it didn't need the vast universe. It didn't need to and did not
explore the implications of deep time. Instead, all the time that passed as
the ships flew around felt like a diligent physics student answering questions
for a final exam: _"If a ship accelerates smoothly to 0.9c and then
decelerates back to 0 over a 10,000ly trip, what amount of time passes for a)
an outside observer, and b) the crew of the ship?"_ Who cares!

Like much of modern sci-fi, {{ this_book }} pays homage to {{ wolfes }} {{
botns }}. The Curators are a direct homage to the Megatherians: they achieve
immortality through constant physical growth, must live in fluid due to their
size, and have vast knowledge. The planet Neume has a giant skull mountain
reminiscent of Typhon's mountain. The main city is Ymir, sharing a name with
another character from {{ botns }}, and also referencing the giant whose body
became the world in Norse mythology, just like the city is built on a giant
stone hand.

Overall, a disappointing start, but if Reynolds can improve his writing, I may
enjoy his next books. I will certainly give at least one more a shot.
