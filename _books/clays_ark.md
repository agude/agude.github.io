<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is the third book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It follows Eli
Doyle, an astronaut, after he has returned to earth with an alien infection
and attempts to contain it.

Like the previous books in the {{ series }} series, {{ this_book }} focuses on
a loosely-defined "family" trying to survive in a world hostile to their
differences. In {{ p1 }}, it was Doro and his children; in {{ p2 }}, it was
Mary and the Patternists; and in this book, it is Eli and his ranch of people
infected with the alien parasite brought back from Proxima Centauri.[^strain]
All three of those characters---Doro, Mary, and Eli---are forced to perform
questionable, even evil, acts because of their biology, and the stories
revolve around how they choose to act despite those constraints.

[^strain]: Which reminds me a bit of {{ crichtons }} {{ andromeda }}.

{{ this_book }} is also a slave story, but here the master is a parasite
rather than a person. Those infected slowly lose their free will, compelled to
spread the infection. Eli and his people struggle to retain their humanity by
spreading the parasite slowly and in a controlled manner. They aim to prevent
the extinction of the human race while still being forced by the parasite to
kidnap new victims.

The plotting was a lot better than in {{ p2 }}, but overall, this series has
convinced me that {{ the_author }} is more focused on characters than plots.
The characters are more interesting than the ones in {{ p2 }}, but far weaker
than Doro and Anyanwu in {{ p1 }}.

It feels like {{ the_author }} fell into the worldbuilder's trap. She wrote {{
p4 }} and then seemed to think "Hmm, I wonder how this came to be", leading
her to write {{ p2 }} and this book. Both books fill in gaps in the history,
but don't tell compelling stories.

I'll be moving on to {{ p4 }} next, and I'm looking forward to finally
wrapping up the {{ series }} series.
