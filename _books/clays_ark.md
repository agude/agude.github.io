Like the previous books in the {{ series }} series, {{ this_book }} focuses on
a loosely-defined "family", trying to survive in a world hostile to their
differences. In {{ p1 }} is was Doro and his children, in {{ p2 }} is was Mary
and the Patternists, and in this book it is Eli and his ranch of people
infected with the alien parasite brought back from Proxima Centauri.[^strain]
All three of those characters---Doro, Mary, Eli---are forced to perform evil
acts because of their biology, and the stories are built around how they
decide to act.

[^strain]: Which reminds me a bit of {{ crichtons }} {{ andromeda }}.

{{ this_book }} is also a slave story, except the master is a parasite instead
of a being. Those infected slowly lose their freewill and are forced to try to
spread the infection. Eli and his people struggle to retain their humanity by
spreading the parasite slowly and in a controlled manner, attempting to
prevent the extinction of the human race, while being forced by it to kidnap
new victims.

The plotting was a lot better than {{ p2 }}, but from this series it seems {{
the_author }} is more interested in writing characters than plots. The
characters feel more real than the ones in {{ p2 }}, even though there are a
lot of them, but far weaker than Doro and Anyanwu in {{ p1 }}.

It does feel like {{ the_author }} fell into the worldbuilder's trap, where
she wrote {{ p4 }} and then thought "Hmm, I wonder how this came to be" and
wrote {{ p2 }} and {{ p3 }} to answer it. Both books feel like they intended
to fill in holes in history than tell a compelling story.

I'll be moving on to {{ p4 }} next, and am looking forward to putting the {{
series }} series behind me.
