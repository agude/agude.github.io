<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span

<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It concludes the
Cinto DaSelva campaign and further develops the setting's backstory.

While similar in length to previous books in the series, {{ this_book }} feels
much faster-paced. The story is divided into three main sections:

- The first part takes place on Cinto DaSelva, where the rebellion and
  Chevaliers launch an ill-advised attack at union-leader Helene DeChile's
  command. Despite warnings from the mercenaries, the advance stretches their
  supply lines and ends in disaster.

- The second part moves to a Paladin Devils ship, where the Chevaliers
  conspire with their employer to remove the power-hungry and increasingly
  unstable Helene from command.

- The third part returns to Cinto DaSelva, as the Chevaliers put their
  assassination plot into motion. Using wormholes to bypass the front line,
  they assault the capital and end up in a brutal fight against the paranoid
  Helene and her remaining loyalists.

The transitions between these three parts aren't as smooth as in {{ w3 }}, but
they're still more polished than {{ w2 }}.

The mech battles are well written, with some unique twists, and feel like they
have high stakes. {{ the_author }} has done a good job of scaling up the mimic
threat, making it pivotal to both taking the capital and covering up Helene's
assassination.

The book plants several seeds for future storylines: Vandel's developing
relationship with Duri; Duri's company's work on revolutionary power-armor
that could shake up the balance of power in the region; the introduction of
the Romans as a mysteriously vanished advanced civilization; and deeper
exploration of the Paladin Devils from {{ w1 }}, with old rivalries reignited.

With the Cinto DaSelva plot-line wrapped up, I'm excited to see where {{ w5 }}
will take the series next.
