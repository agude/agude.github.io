<cite class="book-title">Dog Soldier</cite> is the fourth book in the War
Horses series. In it, Warren concludes the Cinto DaSelva campaign and further
develops the setting's backstory.

Although roughly the same length as the previous books in the series, <cite
class="book-title">Dog Soldier</cite> feels much shorter or, at least, quicker
to get through. The book is divided into three main sections:

- The first part takes place on Cinto DaSelva, where the rebellion and
  Chevaliers make an ill-advised attack at the command of the union-leader
  Helene DeChile. The advance stretches their supply lines and ends
  disastrously, as the mercenaries had warned.

- The second part takes place on a Paladin Devils ship, where the Chevaliers
  plot with their employer to remove the power-hungry and crazed Helene from
  command.

- The third part takes place back on Cinto DaSelva, as the Chevaliers put the
  assassination plot into motion. They assault the capital using wormholes to
  bypass the front line and end up in a knock-down-drag-out fight with the
  increasingly paranoid Helene and the last of her loyalists.

The transition between these three parts is not as clean as in the previous
book, {% include book_link.html title="Serpent Valley" %}, but still better
than {% include book_link.html title="Ymir" %}.

The mech battles are well written, with some unique twists, and feel like they
have high stakes. The author has done a good job of scaling up the mimic
threat, making it pivotal to both taking the capital and covering up Helene's
assassination.

The book sets up several possible future stories: Vandel's courtship of Duri
continues; Duri's company has started to prototype true power-armor; the
Romans are introduced as a super-advanced but disappeared faction; and the
Paladin Devils from {% include book_link.html title="Chevalier" %} are
fleshed-out, with old grudges renewed.

With the Cinto DaSelva plot-line wrapped up, I'm excited to see where the next
book, {% include book_link.html title="Grand Melee" %}, will take us.
