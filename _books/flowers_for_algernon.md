<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a Hugo and Nebula winning
story that follows Charlie Gordon, a mentally disabled man who undergoes
surgery to improve his mind. It is a beautifully written story that just did
not grab me.

{% capture this_book %}<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>{% endcapture %}

{{ this_book }} is written a series of progress reports by Charlie before and
after his surgery. Keyes does an excellent job using the way Charlie writes to
communicate how his intellect is improving bit by bit, and he does an equally
excellent job at the end: it is an emotional moment when the typos reappear
after a hundred pages indicating Charlie's decline.
