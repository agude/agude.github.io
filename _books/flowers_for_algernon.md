<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a Hugo and Nebula winning
novel that tells the story of Charlie Gordon, a mentally disabled man who
undergoes surgery to improve his mind. It is a beautifully written story that
just did not grab me.

{% capture this_book %}<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>{% endcapture %}

{{ this_book }} is written a series of progress reports by Charlie before and
after his surgery. Keyes does an excellent job using the way Charlie writes to
communicate how his intellect is improving bit by bit, and he does an equally
excellent job at the end: it is an emotional moment when the typos reappear
after a hundred pages indicating Charlie's decline.

But the story itself felt predictable: I knew Charlie would get better,
realize his friends weren't really, misunderstand women while looking for
love, and then deteriorate as the effect wore off. And it was heart-breaking
to watch Charlie realize how his family and friends had mistreated him.

There are some interesting ideas in common between {{ this_book }} and {%
include book_link.html title="Blindsight" %} and {% include book_link.html
title="Exchopraxia" %}: specifically about how changing the mind changes who
you are, and if you change it enough you are a different person. I think {{
this_book }} making the "other person" someone Charlie literally sees was an
interesting way to demonstrate the point.

In the end thought, a book that has some great components, but doesn't come
together for me.
