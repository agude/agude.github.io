<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a Hugo and Nebula
award-winning novel about Charlie Gordon, a man with intellectual disabilities
who undergoes surgery to enhance his cognitive abilities. While it is a
beautifully crafted narrative, it failed to captivate me.

{% capture this_book %}<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>{% endcapture %}

{{ this_book }} is written as a series of progress reports by Charlie, both
before and after his surgery. Keyes skillfully utilizes Charlie's writing
style to convey the gradual improvement in his intellect, and he does an
equally remarkable job towards the end: it is an emotional moment when the
typos reappear after a hundred pages, indicating Charlie's cognitive decline.

But, the storyline itself felt flat: I knew it was going to be a story of
Charlie finding out his world was more complicated than it seemed: that his
friends were not really his friends, that his family was not really the
defenders he hoped. Several times while reading, I felt like I knew what was
coming, and so I just needed to grit my teeth and push through to get to the
next part of the story. At other points I debated putting it down and not
picking it back up, especially during the parts where Charlie is abused by his
mother.

There are some interesting parallels between {{ this_book }} and {% include
book_link.html title="Blindsight" %} and {% include book_link.html
title="Echopraxia" %}: specifically regarding how altering the mind changes
one's identity, and if the change is significant enough, it creates a
different person altogether. {{ this_book }}'s depiction of Charlie literally
seeing the "other person" out in the world was an clever approach to
illustrate this concept.

In the end thought, a book that has some great components, but doesn't come
together for me.
