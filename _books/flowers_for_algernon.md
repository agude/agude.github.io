<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a Hugo and Nebula
award-winning novel about Charlie Gordon, a man with intellectual disabilities
who undergoes surgery to enhance his cognitive abilities. While it is a
beautifully crafted narrative, it failed to captivate me.

{% capture this_book %}<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>{% endcapture %}

{{ this_book }} is written as a series of progress reports by Charlie, both
before and after his surgery. Keyes skillfully utilizes Charlie's writing
style to convey the gradual improvement in his intellect, and he does an
equally remarkable job towards the end: it is an emotional moment when the
typos reappear after a hundred pages, indicating Charlie's cognitive decline.

But, the storyline itself felt predictable: I knew that Charlie would
experience cognitive enhancement, realize his friends were not really friends,
misunderstand women while seeking love, and ultimately deteriorate as the
effects wore off. It was heart-breaking to witness Charlie's realization of
how his family and friends had mistreated him.

There are some interesting parallels between {{ this_book }} and {% include
book_link.html title="Blindsight" %} and {% include book_link.html
title="Echopraxia" %}: specifically regarding how altering the mind changes
one's identity, and if the change is significant enough, it creates a
different person altogether. {{ this_book }}'s depiction of Charlie literally
seeing the "other person" out in the world was an interesting approach to
illustrate this concept.

In the end thought, a book that has some great components, but doesn't come
together for me.
