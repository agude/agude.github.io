<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a Hugo and Nebula
award-winning novel about Charlie Gordon, a man with intellectual disabilities
who undergoes surgery to enhance his cognitive abilities. While it is a
beautifully crafted narrative, it failed to hold my attention.

{{ this_book }} is written as a series of progress reports by Charlie, both
before and after his surgery. {{ the_author }} skillfully utilizes Charlie's
writing style to convey the gradual improvement in his intellect, and does an
equally remarkable job towards the end: it is an emotional moment when the
typos reappear after a hundred pages, indicating Charlie's cognitive decline.

But, the storyline itself felt predictable: I anticipated that it would depict
Charlie's realization that his seemingly simple world had unknown
complexities---that his friends were not truly his friends, and that his
family was not the protective support system he had hoped for. Several times
while reading, I could see what must be coming in the next few pages, which
left me to grit my teeth and push through to the next plot point. At other
times, especially when Charlie was enduring the abuse of his mother, I
contemplated abandoning the book altogether.

There are some interesting parallels between {{ this_book }} and {{ blindsight
}} and {{ echopraxia }}: specifically regarding how altering the mind changes
one's identity, and if the change is significant enough, it creates a
different person altogether. {{ this_book }}'s depiction of Charlie literally
seeing the "other person" out in the world was a clever approach to illustrate
this concept.

In the end though, a book that has some great components, but doesn't come
together for me.
