I went into {{ this_book }} knowing only that it was highly acclaimed and that
you played a detective solving a murder. That didn't begin to do it justice.
{{ this_book }} is one of the best video games ever made. The writing is
incredible. The voice acting brings every character---and all 24 voices in
Harry's head---to life. The world is exciting, strange, and alive. It's my
favorite video game, and it's a literary masterpiece.

### There Is Nothing; Only Warm, Primordial Blackness

The player controls Harry Du Bois, a man who wakes up almost naked in a
trashed hotel room with no memory and has to piece his life back together.
Over time, he learns he's a cop. A damn good one. He's in Martinaise. He's
there to solve a murder. He was in love once. He blasted his mind into pieces
with alcohol and drugs. Harry is the perfect window into Elysium because he
knows nothing about himself or the world. This lets the player discover the
setting alongside him.

The world of {{ this_book }} is almost an alternate history. You can map
Elysium to real-world inspirations: Martinaise and Revachol are France; Graad
is Russia; Oranje is the Netherlands; Seol is Japan and Korea; Mesque is Spain
and Mexico. Even the events and figures in the game have clear analogues: the
Antecentennial Revolution and Kras Mazov are the October Revolution and Karl
Marx; Samara is Southeast Asia and the war-crime-ridden conflicts there recall
the Korean and Vietnam wars; the EPIS is the European Union.

That familiarity gives you a false sense of security. It makes it easy to
dismiss the game's magical realism. Harry's 24 talking skills seem like
symptoms of psychosis. The cryptid hunters are just local eccentrics. The
curse on the doomed commercial area is just bad luck.

Then Joyce Messier tells you about the Pale. That Elysium is a shattered world
surrounded by a physics-defying, reality-dissolving mist. Suddenly all your
assumptions collapse. You feel the same confusion Harry must have felt waking
from his self-destruction.

### After The World, The Pale; After The Pale -- The World Again

A major theme of {{ this_book }} is how the past has an unshakable grip on the
present. Harry is the clearest example: he had a good job, a partner, purpose,
a child on the way. He destroyed it all with drugs and alcohol, shattering his
mind into fragments. His entire existence is now spent trying to escape the
fallout of a past he can't---and doesn't want to---remember.

Revachol is the same, haunted by its history. Its buildings are pockmarked
with bullet holes from the failed communist revolution. The Coalition warships
still float above the city, ready to level it, a reminder that Revachol's
autonomy is an illusion. This influence of the past is woven into reality
itself. The Pale is the "rarefied past": the weight of history, memory, and
failure grown so dense that it erases the present.

{{ this_book }} is a tragedy. Revachol doesn't get its revolution. The Pale
continues its advance. But the story of Harry doesn't have to be. Maybe there
is hope for him, something to get him back on his feet for good this time: his
new partner, Kim Kitsuragi.

### This Man Would Hurl Himself in Death's Way to Save You

Kim Kitsuragi. I don't know how to describe him in a way that fully captures
who he is. He's your partner, the anchor who lets you drift but never lets you
get lost. You need that, because the game throws you straight into chaos---you
don't know who you are or where you are---but knowing you can trust Kim gives
you something solid to hold onto.

Kim is one of the best-developed characters in any medium. He is kind,
dependable, utterly loyal. Harry's _Esprit de Corps_ skill puts it best when
they first meet: "If an assault were launched on this building right now -- if
the windows came crashing down and the whole world descended upon you -- this
man would hurl himself in death's way to save you. You are sure of this -- but
why?" And he's more than that. He isn't a sycophant. He has his own history,
his own goals. Uncovering them, and building your relationship with him, is
what makes the game so powerful.

There's one scene that stayed with me. We'd just discovered a car sunken along
the coast, hidden beneath the tide. Kim knows immediately that it's yours,
wrecked during your earlier bender. But he says nothing. He just sits with you
on a swing set for hours, talking, whistling, waiting, until you're ready to
face what you've done. That's who Kim is.

### Something Beautiful is Going to Happen

But despite the bleakness, there is so much beauty in {{ this_book }}. There
is humor and absurdity and friendship and sorrow. There is a man trying to
rebuild a life he forgot, and his stalwart guide and friend helping him along.
The world is doomed. The Pale will destroy it. But despite that, despite
knowing there is no future, there is hope. In a way, that's the story of life.
You are born knowing you'll die, and yet it is wonderful. There is a beauty in
speaking a deep truth about the world, even if that truth is bleak.

The writing is haunting, with wonderfully crafted prose that reminds me of
masterpieces like {{ faulkners }} {{ absalom }}[^gothic] It finds beauty in
the mundane and the decay that permeate Martinaise. This is never clearer than
in the scene describing Harry watching his lost-love as her streetcar recedes
into the distance, which paints the picture perfectly in my mind:

[^gothic]: {{ faulkners }} work and {{ this_book }} share more than fantastic
    prose. Both follow the Gothic tradition, focusing on decaying settings
    where the oppressive weight of a failed past suffocates the present.
    Faulkner's post-Civil War South and the post-revolutionary city of
    Martinaise are haunted by their histories and populated by characters
    psychologically scarred by that trauma.

The prose is brought to life by the fantastic voice actors. Lenval Brown
anchors the performance as the narrator and all 24 voices in Harry's head,
each one with a slightly different personality. The more primal parts of
Harry's brain are voiced by Mikee W. Goodman. The combination of two actors
voicing Harry's thoughts make the arguments in his feel more real. Jullian
Champenois makes Kim feel calm, collected, and so cool. You want to impress
him, to show him that you're not the failure the world thinks you are.
Honestly it's the voices that pulled me in; as beautiful as the prose is, it's
the voices that give it weight.

The music by Sea Power matches the theme and feeling perfectly. The songs are
ethereal and melancholic, but a bright punch of trumpet occasionally pulls you
out of the gloom. My biggest regret is that I can never play {{ this_book }}
for the first time again, but listening to the soundtrack is the closest I can
get, as it instantly takes me back to the moment I first heard each track.

### This Is Somewhere to Be; This Is All You Have, but It's Still Something

{{ this_book }} is not just my favorite game, it is a testament to what the
medium can produce. It answers the question of "Can a video game be art?" so
emphatically that it makes the questioner seem quaint. It shows that a game
can be a literary work that rivals the greatest novels, and can be damn fun
while doing it.
