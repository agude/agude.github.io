{{ this_book }} is probably the best video game ever mad, and it's my favorite.
It is not a book. But it is a literary masterpiece.

### Elysium

The player plays <!-- TODO: Play play is bad repetition. --> Harrier "Harry"
Du Bois, a man who wakes up almost naked in a trashed hotel room with no
memory and has to put his world back together. Over time he learns that he's a
cop. A damn good one. He's in Martinaise. He's there to solve a murder. He was
in love once. He blew his mind away with alcohol and drugs. Harry is the
perfect window in Elysium because he knows nothing of himself or the world.
This lets author slowly build the world for the player as Harry rediscovers
it.

The world of {{ this_book }} is almost an alternate history. You can map the
game world of Elysium to the real world inspirations: Revachol and Martinaise
are France; Graad is Russia; Oranje is the Netherlands; Seol is Japan and
Korea; Mesque is Spain and Mexico. Even in-game events and people map to real
ones: the Antecentennial Revolution and Kras Mazov are the October Revolution
and Karl Marx; Samara is Southeast Asia and the various war-crime ridden
conflicts there are the Korean and Vietnam war; the EPIS is the European
Union.
 
This familiarity is used to distract the player, to lull them into a false
sense of security. Then when the magical realism first shows up, the player is
taken off guard.

### After The World, The Pale; After The Pale---The World Again

A major theme of {{ this_book }} is the cyclical nature of life; of failure
and perseverance; of destroying yourself and coming back.
Harry is the most obvious example of this theme: he had a good job, a wife,
purpose, a child on the way and he destroyed it all with drugs and alcohol,
blasting his mind into fragments personalities and erasing his memories. But
that isn't the end for Harry, that's where the story starts.

Revachol itself also goes through cycles. Once a powerful, fascist empire, it
was destroyed during a communist uprising. As it recovers, it again destroyed
by the Coalition of Nations.

This cyclic nature is built into the very fabric of reality. The Pale is
slowly growing, enveloping and destroying Elysium. But once it's done, the
world will be born anew. "After

 How about Martinaise being destroyed and coming back. About the
world being destroyed and coming back. 

But despite the bleakness, there is so much beauty in {{ this_book }}. There
is humor and absurdity and friendship and sorrow. There is a man trying to
rebuild his life, a life he forgot, and his stalwart guide and friend helping
him along. The world is doomed. The Pale will destroy it. But despite that,
despite knowing there is no future, there is hope. In a way that's the story
of life. You are born knowing you'll die, and yet it is wonderful.
