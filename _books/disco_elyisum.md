Disco Elysium probably needs no introduction but I'll do it anyway: it's
probably the best video game ever made, and it's my favorite. But what it
clearly isn't is a book. I don't care because this is my website and it's a
literary experience.

### Elysium

Disco Elysium is almost an alternate history. You can map the game world of
Elysium to the real world inspirations: Revachol and Martinaise are France;
Graad is Russia; Oranje is the Netherlands; Seol is Japan and Korea; Mesque is
Spain and Mexico. Even in-game events and people map to real ones: The
Antecentennial Revolution and Kras Mazov are the October Revolution and Karl
Marx; the Samara is Southeast Asia and the various war-crime ridden conflicts
there are the Korean and Vietnam war, along with all the other Cold War proxy
fights; the EPIS is the European Union.
 
But this familiarity is used to distract the player, to make them feel like
they understand the world. Then when the magical realism first shows up, the
player is taken off guard.

### After The World, The Pale; After The Pale---The World Again

A major theme of {{ this_book }} is the cyclical nature of life; of failure
and perseverance; of destroying yourself and coming back.
Harry is the most obvious example of this theme: he had a good job, a wife,
purpose, a child on the way and he destroyed it all with drugs and alcohol,
blasting his mind into fragments personalities and erasing his memories. But
that isn't the end for Harry, that's where the story starts.

Revachol itself also goes through cycles. Once a powerful, fascist empire, it
was destroyed during a communist uprising. As it recovers, it again destroyed
by the Coalition of Nations.

This cyclic nature is built into the very fabric of reality. The Pale is
slowly growing, enveloping and destroying Elysium. But once it's done, the
world will be born anew. "After

 How about Martinaise being destroyed and coming back. About the
world being destroyed and coming back. 


But despite the bleakness, there is so much beauty in {{ this_book }}. There  is humor and absurdity and friendship and sorrow.
There is a man trying to rebuild his life, a life he forgot, and his stalwart guide and friend helping him along.
The world is doomed. The Pale will distroy it. But despite that, despite knowing there is no future, there is hope. In a way that's the story of life. You are born knowing you'll die, and yet it is wonderful.
