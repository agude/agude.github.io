{{ this_book }} is probably the best video game ever made, <!-- WHY --> and
it's my favorite. It is not a book. But it is a literary masterpiece.

### There Is Nothing; Only Warm, Primordial Blackness

The player controls Harrier "Harry" Du Bois, a man who wakes up almost naked
in a trashed hotel room with no memory and has to piece his life back
together. Over time, he learns he's a cop. A damn good one. He's in
Martinaise. He's there to solve a murder. He was in love once. He blasted his
mind apart with alcohol and drugs. Harry is the perfect window into Elysium
because he knows nothing about himself or the world. That lets the author
slowly build the world for the player as Harry rediscovers it.

The world of {{ this_book }} is almost an alternate history. You can map the
game world of Elysium to real-world inspirations: Revachol and Martinaise are
France; Graad is Russia; Oranje is the Netherlands; Seol is Japan and Korea;
Mesque is Spain and Mexico. Even in-game events and people have clear
analogues: the Antecentennial Revolution and Kras Mazov are the October
Revolution and Karl Marx; Samara is Southeast Asia, and the war-crime-ridden
conflicts there echo the Korean and Vietnam wars; the EPIS is the European
Union.

That familiarity is used to distract the player, to lull them into a false
sense of security. So when the magical realism kicks in, it hits harder. It's
disorienting. It makes you feel the way Harry must feel.

I ignored a lot of the early hints that Elysium is not Earth. Harry's 24,
seemingly sentient skills that talk to each other? The man is blasted out of
his mind. The scientist obsessed with cryptids? Just some weirdos --- we have
them here too. A talking necktie? Again, Harry is crazy. The world is a bunch
of shattered landmasses connected by physics-defying, all-consuming,
ever-expanding Pale? Wait...

### After The World, The Pale; After The Pale -- The World Again

A major theme of {{ this_book }} is the cyclical nature of life; of failure
and redemption; of how history repeats over and over. Harry is the most
obvious example of this theme: he had a good job, a wife, purpose, a child on
the way. He destroyed it all with drugs and alcohol, blasting his mind into
fragmented personalities and erasing his memories. But that isn't the end for
Harry---that's where his story starts.

Revachol itself also goes through cycles. Once the seat of a powerful, fascist
empire, it fell into moral decay before being torn apart by a communist
uprising. From the ashes rose the Commune, which was then crushed by the
Coalition of Nations. This cyclical pattern is built into the very fabric of
reality. The Pale is slowly growing, enveloping and dissolving Elysium. But
once it's done, the world will be born anew. "After the world, the Pale;
after the Pale -- the world again."

But the Pale is more than just a force of destruction. It is the "rarefied
past"---the accumulated weight of all the history, memory, and failure of the
world, grown so dense it dissolves the present. That same weight mirrors
Harry's internal collapse: his past mistakes threatening to erase who he is.

Through all this chaos, through the endless loop of collapse and recovery,
there is one constant: Kim Kitsuragi, your partner.

### This Man Would Hurl Himself in Death's Way to Save You

Kim Kitsuragi. I do not know how to describe him in a way that will fully
convey what he is. He's your partner, the anchor that lets you drift, but
doesn't let you get lost. And you need that, because the game throws you
straight into chaos---you don't know who you are or where you are---but the
fact that you can trust Kim gives you something solid to hold onto.

He is one of the best developed characters in any media. He is kind,
dependable, utterly loyal. Harry's _Esprit de Corps_ skill puts it best when
they first meet: "If an assault were launched on this building right now -- if
the windows came crashing down and the whole world descended upon you -- this
man would hurl himself in death's way to save you. You are sure of this -- but
why?" He is more than that. He isn't a sycophant. He has his own deep history
and goals. Uncovering them, and building the rapport between you two, is what
makes the game so powerful.

<!-- Not really tears? -->
There's one scene that almost had me in tears. We'd just discovered a car sunk
along the coast and covered by the tide. Kim knows immediately that it's
yours, wrecked during your earlier bender. But he says nothing. He just sits
on a swing set with you for hours, talking, whistling, waiting, until you're
ready to face what you've done. That's who Kim is.

### Something Beautiful is Going to Happen

But despite the bleakness, there is so much beauty in {{ this_book }}. There
is humor and absurdity and friendship and sorrow. There is a man trying to
rebuild a life he forgot, and his stalwart guide and friend helping him along.
The world is doomed. The Pale will destroy it. But despite that, despite
knowing there is no future, there is hope. In a way, that's the story of life.
You are born knowing you'll die, and yet it is wonderful.

The writing is haunting. Its phrases still echo in my mind.[^bow]
