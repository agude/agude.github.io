betrayal in an early-industrial kingdom housed in a shellworld, and ends with a
cosmic horror being unleashed.

{{ this_book }} starts with the murder of the king of Sarl by his
right-hand-man, Mertis tyl Loesp, just as the king's force defeat the invading
Deldeyn army. The book follows the king's three children---the playboy Prince
Ferbin, the young scholar Prince Oramen, and the Princess-turned-culture-agent
Djan Seriy Anaplian---as they navigate the betrayal of their father.

One of the things I love about {{ the_authors }} writing is the sense of place
he brings to his stories. They contain unique locations that feel so real and
which I remember long after putting the book down: the mile-long megaships in
{{ c1 }}, the fiery fortress in {{ c2 }}, landlocked battleship in {{ c3 }},
the glacial mass-grave in {{ c5 }}, the cable cars and airsphere in {{ c7 }}.
{{ this_book }} does not disappoint on that front.

Most of the story takes place on the shellworld Sursamen, a megastructure
formed of concentric spherical shells. Sarl is on the eighth level down from
the surface, and their enemies the Deldeyn, are on the ninth. The shell world
is jointly (and contentiously) controlled by the advanced civilizations the
Oct and the Aultridia.

The Oct believe themselves to be the descendants of the builders of the
shellworlds, the Involucra. The Oct and Aultridia are in turn monitored by the
more powerful Nariscene, who are monitored by the still more powerful
Morthanveld, who the Culture have taken an interest in as the species is about
to become "Culture-like". And so we see one of the themes of {{ this_book }}:
hierarchy. Their are multiple hierarchies in the book: the ladder of species in
the galaxy, the levels of the shellworld, and the organizations of the various
governments.

The first part of the book superficially resembles {{ martins }} {{ thrones
}}, with its intrigue and ruthless quest for power set in a chivalrous
society, but all of that is in fact a distraction. After the backstabbing is
done, the main story is closer to {{ lovecrafts }} {{ nameless }}: a nameless
city is being revealed by the massive Hyeng-zhar waterfall (another of {{
the_authors }} wonderful places), full of ancient and advanced artifacts, and
one in particular that is conscious and has laid sleeping for eons waiting to
be awakened.

Unfortunately the cosmic horror---revealed to be Iln, a race that destroyed
many shellworlds in the past before vanishing---is underwhelming. It appears
in the last tenth of the book, and the whole novel pivots to dealing with it.
Although that sounds exciting---the Culture versus a super-advanced power---it
feels too rushed, and at the same time too long. So many of the paragraphs in
this section describe Djan and Ferbin walking through passageways and doors.
