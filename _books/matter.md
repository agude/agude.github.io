<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>, is the eighth <span

betrayal in an early-industrial kingdom housed within a shellworld, and ends
with the unleashing of a cosmic horror.

{{ this_book }} opens with the murder of the king of Sarl by his right-hand
man, Mertis tyl Loesp, just as the king's forces defeat an invading Deldeyn
army. The story follows the king's three children---the playboy Prince Ferbin,
the young scholar Prince Oramen, and the Princess-turned-Culture-agent Djan
Seriy Anaplian---as they deal with their father's betrayal and death.

One of the strongest aspects of {{ the_authors }} writing is the sense of
place he brings to his stories. His books feature unique locations that feel
real and which I remember long after putting the book down: the colossal
megaships in {{ c1 }}, the fiery fortress in {{ c2 }}, the landlocked
battleship in {{ c3 }}, the glacial mass-grave in {{ c5 }}, and the
wind-powered cable cars and airsphere in {{ c7 }}. {{ this_book }} continues
this tradition.

The story largely takes place on the shellworld Sursamen, a megastructure made
of concentric spherical shells. The kingdom of Sarl exists on the eighth level
down from the surface, while their enemies, the Deldeyn, occupy the ninth. The
shellworld is jointly administered (and disputed) by two advanced
civilizations: the Oct and the Aultridia, who both manipulate the inhabitants
for their own purposes. The Oct believe themselves to be descendants of the
shellworlds' builders, the Involucra, and search Sursamen for proof of this
connection.

The Oct and Aultridia themselves are monitored by the more powerful Nariscene,
who in turn are monitored by the even more advanced Morthanveld---a species
the Culture has taken interest in as they approach "Culture-like" status. This
introduces one of {{ this_book }}'s central themes: hierarchy. The novel
explores multiple hierarchical structures: the technological ladder of
galactic species, the physical levels of the shellworld, the organization of
various governments, and the layers of manipulation and scheming between
species.

The book's first section superficially resembles {{ martins }} {{ thrones }},
with its political intrigue, betrayal, and power struggles set in a chivalrous
society. However, this proves to be misdirection. After the political
machinations conclude, the story shifts closer to {{ lovecrafts }} {{ nameless
}}: the massive Hyeng-zhar waterfall (another of {{ the_authors }} memorable
locations) reveals an ancient, nameless city containing advanced artifacts,
including one that is conscious and has remained sleeping for eons, waiting to
awaken.

The cosmic horror---revealed to be a creation of the Iln, an ancient race that
destroyed many shellworlds before vanishing---ultimately falls short of its
setup. It appears in the final tenth of the book, causing an abrupt shift in
focus. Although the Culture versus a super-advanced power sounds exciting, it
feels both too rushed and at the same time too drawn out. A large part of this
section is describing Djan and Ferbin walking down passageways and opening
doors as they traverse the shellworld heading towards its core. The final
confrontation ends (intentionally) very suddenly. I had expected something
quite different: a story of Djan using her advanced training and technology to
guide the development of Sarl, but the narrative takes a sharp turn away from
that.

Still an enjoyable book with some unforgettable places. Next up is {{ left }}
for my book club, before I continue the {{ this_series }} with {{ c9 }}.
