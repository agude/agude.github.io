<cite class="book-title">The State of the Art</cite> is a collection of short
stories by Iain M. Banks. It contains some stories related to the Culture
universe and some general science fiction tales. Although it has been
considered utopian fiction, it comes across as rather bleak.

### Road of Skulls
{% include book_rating.html rating=2 %}

A cart travels along a road paved with skulls, chasing a city that lays the
road behind it as it moves. Nothing happens in this story.

### A Gift from the Culture
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

A Culture-woman living in a lower-tech civilization is pressured into
committing an assassination with a gun that will only fire for a Culture
human. Banks packs a lot of depth into this short story, making me care about
the protagonist in just a few pages.

The protagonist is queer---a woman who chose to become a man because she knew
she'd be safer in the backward society that way. Despite her gender change,
she finds herself still attracted to men and starts a gay relationship,
something the society does not tolerate.

It is unknown who orders the assassination, as it could be the mob, religious
fanatics, or even the Culture itself. This ambiguity allowed me to ponder the
motives behind the assassination.

### Odd Attachment
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

A love-sick plant monster rends a spaceman limb-from-limb like a daisy in the
game of ["He loves me, he loves me not"][daisy]. This story serves as a
10-page setup for a dick joke (the "odd attachment" being the man's penis,
giving the monster 21 digits to rip off).

### Descendant
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

A man and his sentient spacesuit crash on a planet and have to walk for months
to reach rescue. Although not explicitly stated, this is probably a Culture
tale.

Banks does an excellent job of making the story seem bleak and claustrophobic.
The man---and the reader---are not sure if the suit is really on his side.
When the man dies, the suit keeps him around out of sentimentality, answering
our question. The "Descendant" refers to the suit (and a drone at the end)
that are, in some ways, the mankind's descendants.

### Cleaning Up
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

This story is a parody of the military-industrial complex during the Cold War,
written in a golden-age of sci-fi style. Aliens discover that their trash
system, which should send junk into the nearest star, instead sent it to
Earth, where humans interpreted it as gifts. It's good fun, albeit a little
over-the-top.

### Piece
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

A reflection on the extreme lengths religions drive people to, written by a
man on the [Lockerbie flight][lockerbie] just before it explodes.

### The State of the Art
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

The largest part of the book, <cite class="book-title">The State of the
Art</cite> is a novella featuring Diziet Sma and the drone Skaffen-Amtiskaw
from {% include book_link.html title="Use of Weapons" %} as they visit Earth
in 1977 and have to decide whether to contact it or not.

<cite class="book-title">The State of the Art</cite> once again raises the
question---as was asked in {% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas"
%}, {% include book_link.html title="The Player of Games" %}, and {% include
book_link.html title="Use of Weapons" %}---of whether the Culture's
homogenizing influence is ultimately beneficial or if it robs people of the
elements that give life meaning.

I was worried that the vignettes where the Culture people visit various places
on Earth would be kitschy, but I actually enjoyed them. Unfortunately, Banks
decides to ["tell, not show"][sdt] by making some characters mouthpieces who
lecture at each other (and the reader), which really throws off the story's
flow. Flow is particularly important in short writing!

The ending was predictable and heavy-handed: Banks decided to start showing
again by having the character who defended Earth's liveliness mugged and
murdered in an alley in New York.

### Scratch
{% include book_rating.html rating=1 %}

A stream-of-consciousness narrative in the form of [found art][found_art] text
clippings from the future. I did not finish this story.
