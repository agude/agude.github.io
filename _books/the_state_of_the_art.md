<span class="book-title">The State of the Art</span> is a collection of short
stories by Iain M. Banks. It


### Road of Skulls
{% include book_rating.html rating=2 %}

A cart travels a road paved in skulls, chasing a city laying the path behind
it. Nothing happens.

### A Gift from the Culture
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

A Culture-woman living in a lower-tech civilization is pressured into
committing an assassination with a gun that will only fire for a Culture
human. Banks packs so much into this story, and gets us to care about the
protagonist in just a few pages.

The protagonist is queer---she is a woman who choose to become a man because
she knew she'd be safer in the backwards-society that way. Despite her gender
change, she finds she is still attracted to men and starts up a gay
relationship, something the society does not tolerate.

We don't know who orders the assassination, but it could be the mob, religious
fanatics, or even the Culture itself. I liked how the ambiguity made me think.

### Odd Attachment
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

A love-sick plant monster rends a spaceman limb-from-limb like a daisy in a
game of ["He loves me, he loves me not"][daisy]. A 10-page set up for a dick
joke (the odd attachment being the man's penis, giving him 21 digits to rip
off).

### Descendant
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

A man and his sentient spacesuit crash on a planet and have to walk for months
to reach rescue. Probably a Culture tale, although not explicitly said to be
(and some of the nomenclature used is wrong, like rings instead of orbitals).
Banks does a good job of making the story seem bleak and claustrophobic. The
man dies, and the suit keeps him around out of sentimentality. The
"descendant" is the suit (and a drone) that are, in some ways, the man's
descendants.

### Cleaning Up
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

Golden-age sci-fi written as a parody of the military-industrial complex
during the Cold War. Aliens discover their trash system (which should send
junk into the nearest star) instead sent it to Earth, who interpreted it as
gifts. Good fun, if a little over-the-top.

### Piece
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

A reflection on the extreme lengths religions drive people to, written by a
man on the [Lockerbie flight][lockerbie] just before it explodes.

### The State of the Art
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

The largest part of the book, <span class="book-title">The State of the
Art</span> is a novella featuring Diziet Sma and the drone Skaffen-Amtiskaw
from {% include book_link.html title="Use of Weapons" %} as they visit 1977's
Earth and have to decide whether to contact it or not.

<span class="book-title">The State of the Art</span> once again asks the
question---as was asked in {% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %},
{% include book_link.html title="The Player of Games" %}, and
{% include book_link.html title="User of Weapons" %}---if the Culture's
intervention is good, and if the Culture itself lacks life because of the lack
of challenge.

### Scratch
{% include book_rating.html rating=1 %}

A stream of consciousness narrative in the form of [found art][found_art]
text-clippings from the future. Did not finish.
