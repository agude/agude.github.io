Once again {{ this_book }} has multiple, independent storylines, some new and
some continuing from {{ bob2 }} and even {{ bob1 }}. Some of the ones that
resonated with me were:

- The war with the others, the defense of Earth, and the destruction of the
  Other's homeworld.
- Life as an android, what legal rights they have, and what rights people have
  to decide what happens to their mind after death.
- The revolution on Poseidon.

My one critique of the {{ bobiverse }} is that storylines are always wrapped
up so neatly and in favor of the Bobs. There are sometimes setbacks---Medeiros
wins a few battles, so do the others, Homer is captured---but inevitably Bob
triumphs in an power-fantasy satisfying sort of way. It feels like a
continuation of the "this book is like a TV show" theme: you have to keep
things moving, close out stories, and give the viewers something viscerally
satisfying. But books can be deeper, and {{ bobiverse }} isn't.

I compared {{ bob2 }} to the {{ commonwealth_saga }}, but one way in which it
is different is no one cares about the destruction of the genocidal Others.
The Bobs destroy the Others' home system and their Dyson Sphere by colliding
two planets into the star and setting off a supernova. Even the un-warlike Bob
realizes it was the only option, unlike many of the characters in {{ pandora
}}.

{{ this_book }} was another fun read, but I'm going to take a break and read
{{ fire }} for my book club before continuing with {{ bob4 }}.
