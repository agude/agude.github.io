Once again, {{ this_book }} features multiple, independent storylines, some
new and some continuing from {{ bob2 }} and even {{ bob1 }}. The ones that
resonated with me most were:

- The war with the Others, the defense of Earth, and the destruction of the
  Others' homeworld.
- Life as an android, exploring the legal rights and the ethical implications
  of deciding what happens to one's mind after death.
- The revolution on Poseidon against the authoritarian council.

My main critique of the {{ bobiverse }} is that storylines are always wrapped
up too neatly and in favor of the Bobs. There are occasional
setbacks---Medeiros wins a few battles, as do the Others, and Homer is
captured---but inevitably Bob triumphs in a power-fantasy satisfying sort of
way. It feels like a continuation of the "this book is like a TV show" theme:
keep things moving, close out stories, and give the viewers something
viscerally satisfying. Books have the potential to be deeper, but {{ bobiverse
}} isn't.

I previously compared {{ bob2 }} to the {{ commonwealth_saga }}, but one
significant difference is that no one seems to care about the destruction of
the genocidal Others. The Bobs destroy the Others' home system and their Dyson
Sphere by colliding two planets into the star and setting off a supernova.
Even the un-warlike Bob realizes it was the only option, unlike many of the
characters in {{ pandora }}.

{{ this_book }} was another fun read, but I'm going to take a break and
re-read {{ fire }} for my book club before continuing with {{ bob4 }}.
