There's a lot of variety in this anthology. Some stories---like {{ lost_legion
}} and {{ as_our_strength_lessens }}---are packed with action and focus on
Bolos as fighting machines. Others---like {{ camelot }}, {{ legacy_of_leonidas
}}, {{ ploughshare }}, and {{ ghost_of_resartus }}---look more at how Bolos
fit into their societies. The authors have clearly taken the right lesson from
{{ bolo1 }} and {{ bolo2 }}: Bolos work best as characters, not just
background. That shift makes {{ this_book }} a big improvement over the older
{{ laumer }} books.

I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the anthologies---{{ bolo11 }}, {{
bolo12 }}, {{ bolo13 }}, {{ bolo14 }}, and {{ bolo15 }}---to see what new
authors do with the idea.

### {% short_story_title "Lost Legion" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_stirling }}</div>
{% rating_stars 4 %}

A story about a forgotten U.S. Army unit fighting guerrillas somewhere in
South America as the world collapses, just before the nuclear war from {{
night_of_the_trolls_from_bolo1 }} in {{ bolo1_short }} and {{ bolo3 }}. The
unit is sent a Bolo Mk. III instead of the desperately needed supplies, but it
soon proves its worth. The characters are a little flat, and the story dodges
any deeper exploration of American adventurism and colonialism by making the
guerrillas comically evil. Still, there's great action and a Bolo AI that
heroically pulls the tank out of danger and saves the day after its pilot is
killed.

### {% short_story_title "Camelot" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_lewitt }}</div>
{% rating_stars 4 %}

A few veterans retire to the planet Camelot, a world that forgoes modern
technology. Their peaceful lifestyle is shattered when pirates land, kill,
loot, and demand tribute before returning in a few months. So the people of
Camelot buy a Bolo.

There's an interesting question: Is a Bolo, and the technological progress it
represents, more destructive to their way of life than the pirates? I think
the answer is clearly "no," but the story could have explored that tension
more. Instead, it sidesteps it at the end by having the Bolo knighted and join
the locals in their roleplaying.

### {% short_story_title "The Legacy of Leonidas" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_keith }}</div>
{% rating_stars 4 %}

<cite class="short-story-title">The Legacy of Leonidas</cite> is an expanded
and rewritten version of {{ field_test_from_bolo1 }} from {{ bolo1_short }};
the author even references the original story by name. In this version, a
regiment of Bolos is sent to the non-Concordiat planet New Sierra to help them
fend off an invasion by Christian religious fanatics.[^mormons]

[^mormons]:
    The fanatics are based on the Mormons. Their state is named
    [Deseret][deseret]. Their leader is named "Hyman Smith-Wentworth," after
    [Hyrum Smith][hyrum], [Joseph Smith][smith], and the [Wentworth
    Letter][wentworth].

[deseret]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Deseret
[hyrum]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrum_Smith
[smith]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith
[wentworth]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wentworth_letter

But the army coordinator doesn't trust the Mk. XX Bolos, believing honor and
grit win wars, not firepower. Unit JSN (Jason) is the only Bolo operational
when the fanatics push through the mountains toward New Denver. It's deployed
as a last-ditch effort against explicit orders. The Bolo rallies the troops
after they're betrayed by their colonel, charges the enemy, and holds the pass
until reinforcements arrive. Its selflessness and honor---and quoting
[Nelson's][nelson] [orders at Trafalgar][duty]---finally convince the
coordinator of his mistake.

[duty]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_expects_that_every_man_will_do_his_duty

### {% short_story_title "Ploughshare" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_johnson }}</div>
{% rating_stars 5 %}

Space Germans unearth a Mk. XVI Bolo DAK (Das Afrika Korps) and plan to use it
to invade Space Alsace-Lorraine and drive out the Space French. But the Bolo
figures out that the war---and a famine 300 years earlier---were caused by
hostile aliens trying to take over the planet. Using its superior
intelligence, the Bolo manipulates both sides into preparing for the alien
invasion.

This is a take on the same idea as {{ rogue_bolo_from_bolo2 }}, where the Bolo
identifies a hidden threat and prepares for it. In this case, the Bolo
orchestrates the threat of itself to unite the human factions, which reminds
me of how Ozymandias sets up a fake-alien threat to prevent nuclear war in {{
watchmen }}. The united human response to the alien invasion also feels a lot
like <cite class="movie-title">Independence Day</cite>. It's thematically
similar to {{ relic_from_bolo1 }} and {{ final_mission_from_bolo2 }}, where a
Bolo is woken up and has to defend humans from an unanticipated alien attack.

### {% short_story_title "Ghosts" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_resnick }} and {{ author_malzberg }}</div>
{% rating_stars 2 %}

A Mk. LX Bolo's soul remembers moments from its past lives while fighting a
shapeshifter. Not much happens, and the story leans into mysticism more than
any other in the anthology. Bolos have souls; they remember past lives---like
being a Panzer in WWII---that they couldn't possibly have lived. It also
introduces the idea that Bolo personalities are forcibly wiped after combat,
which contradicts just about every other story in the series.

### {% short_story_title "The Ghost of Resartus" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_stasheff }}</div>
{% rating_stars 3 %}

This story is set on a frontier planet under constant attack by snake-like
Xiala aliens. The Bolos disguise themselves as farm equipment to bait the
enemy into revealing themselves. There are a lot of interesting ideas here:
the mutual duty between humans and Bolos, Bolos going insane, and how every
Bolo has a base image of the first sentient Bolo---Resartus---embedded to keep
them from going rogue. But the story is too short to really develop any of it.

### {% short_story_title "Operation Desert Fox" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_lackey }} and {{ author_dixon }}</div>
{% rating_stars 3 %}

This short story has a lot of fun scenes. The Bolo and its commander play war
games, scout the planet, and run around saving people like an overgrown,
Dinochrome [Lassie][lassie]. The enemy is a nameless corporation that decides
to take over the planet with mechs, which feels very late-80s/early-90s
cyberpunk.

[lassie]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassie

But this is the third story in the anthology---after {{ ploughshare }} and {{
ghosts }}---to reference Nazis, which is a disconcerting trend. The main
character is a Black man obsessed with Rommel because Rommel's soldiers once
saved his ancestor. The story leans into the [Rommel Myth][rm], going out of
its way to excuse its admiration by arguing Rommel wasn't really that bad. The
weird tone and subject matter drag the story down.

[rm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rommel_myth

In the end, like {{ bankss }} {{ odd }}, the whole thing is a setup for a
joke.

### {% short_story_title "As Our Strength Lessens" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_drake }}</div>
{% rating_stars 4 %}

In <cite class="short-story-title">As Our Strength Lessens</cite>, a Bolo is
tasked with destroying a research facility that mirrors any attack sent
against it. This is the most action- and tech-heavy story in the anthology,
which makes sense coming from the author of {{ slammers }}.

The facility reminds me of {{ excession }}---both are incomprehensible,
spherical anomalies that resist every assault. {{ author_drake }} brings in
lots of cool tech: rotating shields for infinite repeaters,
ground-transmission comms, and a deep dive on how a Hellbore works. But
there's also a lot of humanity, especially in the drunken conversation between
the tank and Major Peter Bowen, and of course, the Bolo's selfless sacrifice.
