### <cite class="short-story-title">Lost Legion</cite>
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_stirling }}</div>
{% rating_stars 4 %}

A story about a forgotten US army unit fighting guerrillas somewhere in South
America, as the world is collapsing right before the nuclear war from {{
night_of_the_trolls_from_bolo1 }} from {{ bolo1 }} and {{ bolo3 }}. The unit
is sent a Bolo Mk. III instead of other much-needed supplies, but it soon
proves its worth. The characters are a little flat and the story dodges any
deeper exploration of American adventurism and colonialism by making the
guerrillas comically evil. Still, there's some great action and a Bolo AI that
brings that tank out of danger and saves the day after its pilot is killed.

### <cite class="short-story-title">Camelot</cite>
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_lewitt }}</div>
{% rating_stars 4 %}

A few veterans retire to the planet of Camelot, a world that foregos modern
technology. Their bucolic lifestyle is shattered when pirates land, kill and
steal, and demand tribute for when they return in a few months. So the people
of Camelot by a Bolo.

The interesting question this story is asking is: is a Bolo, and the
technological advancement it represents, more destructive to their lifestyle
than the pirates? I think the answer is clearly "no", but I could see how the
story could have explored that question. Instead they neatly side-step it at
the end by the Bolo being Knighted and joining the people in their
roleplaying.

### <cite class="short-story-title">The Legacy of Leonidas</cite>
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_keith }}</div>
{% rating_stars 4 %}

<cite class="short-story-title">The Legacy of Leonidas</cite> is an expansion
and rewrite of {{ field_test_from_bolo1 }} from {{ bolo1 }}; the author even
mentions the story by name. In this version, a regiment of Bolos is sent to
the non-Concordiat planet of New Sierra to help them fend off an invasion by
Christian religious fanatics.[^mormons]

[^mormons]:
    The fanatics are based on Mormons. Their state is named
    [Deseret][deseret]. Their leader is named "Hyman Smith-Wentworth" after,
    [Hyrum Smith][hyrum], [Joseph Smith][smith], and the [Wentworth
    Letter][wentworth].

[deseret]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Deseret
[hyrum]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrum_Smith
[smith]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith
[wentworth]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wentworth_letter

But the coordinator of the army doesn't trust the Mk. XX Bolos, thinking that
honor and grit are what win wars, not superior firepower. Unit JSN (Jason) is
the only Bolo operational when the fanatics make a push through the mountains
to New Denver, and it is deployed as a last ditch gambit against the explicit
orders of the coordinator. It rallies the troops after they're betrayed by
their own colonel, charges into the enemy, and holds the pass until
reinforcements can arrive. The Bolo's selflessness and honor---and quoting
[Nelson's][nelson] [orders at Trafalgar][duty]---convinces the Coordinator of
his mistake.

### <cite class="short-story-title">Ploughshare</cite>
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_johnson }}</div>
{% rating_stars 5 %}

Space Germans unearth a Mk. XVI Bolo DAK (Das Afrika Korp) and plan to use it
to invade Space Alsace-Lorraine and drive out the Space French. The Bolo
though figures out that the war---and the famine 300 years earlier---was
caused by hostile aliens that are trying to take over the planet for
themselves. Using it's superior intelligence, the Bolo manipulates both human
sides into preparing for the alien invasion.

This story is a take on the same theme as {{ rogue_bolo_from_bolo2 }}, where
the Bolo recognizes an undetected threat an prepares for it.

The way the Bolo orchestrates an threat, itself, to unite the human factions
reminds me of how Ozymandias sets up an alien threat to prevent a nuclear war
in {{ watchmen }}. The way the humans come together to defeat the alien
invaders reminds me of <cite class="movie-title">Independence Day</cite>. It
is also similar to some previous short stories---like {{ relic_from_bolo1 }}
and {{ final_mission_from_bolo2 }}---where a Bolo is woken up and has to
defend humans from an unanticipated alien attack.

### <cite class="short-story-title">Ghosts</cite>
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_resnick }} and {{ author_malzberg }}</div>
{% rating_stars 3 %}

A Mk. LX Bolo's soul remembers moments from its previous lives while fighting
a shape shifter. Not a lot happens and this story is a little more mystic than
any other. Bolos have souls, they remember their past lives, even lives---like
being a Panzer during WWII---they definitely did not live. Additionally, the
story explains that Bolos have to have their personality forcibly wiped after
combat, which contradicts just about every other story.

### <cite class="short-story-title">The Ghost of Resartus</cite>
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_stasheff }}</div>
{% rating_stars 3 %}

This story takes place on a frontier planet under constant attack by
snake-like Xiala aliens. Bolos work as farm instruments as a ruse to lure the
enemy out of hiding. There are a lot of interesting ideas: how humans and
Bolos feel a duty to each other, how Bolos can go crazy, and how Bolos have a
base image of the first sentient Bolo---Resartus---build into them to prevent
them going rogue.

But the story feels like it's too short for all the ideas.

### <cite class="short-story-title">Operation Desert Fox</cite>
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_lackey }} and {{ author_dixon }}</div>
{% rating_stars 3 %}

This story has a lot of fun Bolo scenes, as the Bolo and its commander play
war games, scout out the planet, and run around saving people like an
over-grown, Dinochrome [Lassie][lassie]. The enemy is a nameless corporation
that decides to take over the planet, which is right out of late 80s, early
90s cyberpunk.

But the story is also the third in the anthology---after {{ ploughshare }} and
{{ ghosts }}---to reference the Nazis, which is a disconcerting trend. 
<cite class="short-story-title">Operation Desert Fox</cite>'s main character
is a black-man who is obsessed with Rommel, because the field marshal's
soldiers once saved the mans ancestor. The story is a propagation of the
[Rommel Myth][rm], and goes out of its way to excuse its infatuation with the
man by defending how he wasn't really all that bad. The weird tone and subject
matter really drags this story down.

[rm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rommel_myth

In the end the entire story, like {{ bankss }} {{ odd }}, is a set up for a
joke.
