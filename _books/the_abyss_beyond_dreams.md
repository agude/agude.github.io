<span class="book-title">The Abyss Beyond Dreams</span> is the first book in
The Chronicle of the Fallers, a series set in Hamilton's Commonwealth
universe. Although nominally a space opera, it is actually closer to urban
fantasy as the majority of the book takes place in on the planet Bienvenido in
the Void, where technology hasn't progressed beyond steam engines.

The book takes place in the same Void from the Void Trilogy (which started
with {% include book_link.html title="The Dreaming Void" %}) and feels, at
first, a little derivative because it parallels Edeard's story: Slvasta, a
young man with psychic powers, who joins the army, leaves the country-side,
travels to the big city, realizes the rulers are less benevolent than they
seem, and decides to overthrow the current order.

The key difference between Querencia and Bienvenido is the Fallers---an alien
terraforming weapon that subsumes and replaces people who touch it.

There are two story-lines:

1. A violent, working-class revolution against the authoritarian government.
   Bienvenido is ruled by a hereditary monarchy descended from the
   captain of the ship that crashed on the planet 3000 years ago. A group
   young people, led by Slvasta, challenges the monarchy first covertly and
   then overtly, taking to the streets with advanced weapons.

2. An _"Outside Context Problem"_[^excession], caused by Nigel Sheldon who has
   infiltrated the Void and came prepared with advanced biotechnology designed
   to work in the tech-hostile pocket universe. He uses his advanced
   technology and superior knowledge to found and control the revolution so
   that he can steal advanced weapons from the king's palace to fight the
   Fallers.

The revolution parts are tense, but still drag. I was expecting sci fi and
these sections barely qualify. But the Sheldon parts make up for it.

One surprising fact was that the book contains a complete story. Normally
Hamilton splits the story across all the books in the series so each one feels
incomplete. However, that meant that it all had to fit and as such the story
felt a little fast.

Still a really fun book I couldn't put down.
