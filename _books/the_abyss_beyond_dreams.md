<span class="book-title">The Abyss Beyond Dreams</span> starts off The
Chronicle of the Fallers, another series in Hamilton's Commonwealth universe.
Though billed as space opera, it often reads more as urban fantasy since most
of the story occurs on the planet Bienvenido inside the Void where steam
engines are their most advanced technology.

Initially, the story parallels Edeard's from the Void Trilogy (started in {%
include book_link.html title="The Dreaming Void" %}), feeling derivative.
Young psychic Slvasta joins the army, leaves his rural home for the capital,
and realizes the seemingly benevolent rulers are corrupt, resolving to
overthrow them.

The core difference lies with the Fallers---an alien terraforming weapon that
consumes and replaces any person it touches.

There are two interwoven storylines:

1. A violent, working-class revolution against Bienvenido's authoritarian
   government ruled by a monarch who is descended from the captain of the
   crashed ship. Slvasta and friends challenge them first through politics and
   then armed uprising.

2. An _"Outside Context Problem"_[^excession] created by Nigel Sheldon, who
   has infiltrated the Void and came prepared with advanced biotechnology
   designed to work in the physics-bending pocket universe. He uses his
   advanced technology and knowledge to initiate and steer the revolution so
   that he can steal advanced weapons from the king's palace to fight the
   Fallers.

The revolution sections are tense, but still drag. I could not wait to get
back to the Sheldon sections

Surprisingly, the book contains a complete story arc, whereas Hamilton
normally splits the story across the entire series. But this did make the
story feel a little too quick. Several challenges I expected would build to
climatic confrontations were resolved in under a page.

Still a book I couldn't put down!
