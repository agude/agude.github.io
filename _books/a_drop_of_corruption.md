I said that {{ book1 }} was a "Homesian detective story", which isn't quite
right: {{ the_author }} has clarified that he was inspired by {{ stouts }} {{
nero_wolfe_series }}. Although I haven't read that series, the fit does seem
to be better. Both Nero and Ana are armchair detectives who listen to reports
from their partners with enhanced memory about the case to solve it rather
than investigate, while Holmes traipsed about all over England.[^mycroft]
Perhaps I'll have to pick up the first book, {{ fdr }}, soon.

[^mycroft]: Sherlock's older brother, Mycroft, _is_ an armchair detective.

In {{ this_book }}, Din and Ana travel to the northern Kingdom of Yarrow to
solve the murder of a treasury officer. The officer was thought to have been
abducted from his locked room, but Din and Ana quickly realize that the man
everyone thought was the official was actually the murder, and that he has
been planning to disrupt the flow of reagents into the Empire by disruption
the Shroud, a special containment structure in which leviathans are butchered.

I really enjoyed the mystery and the introduction of a villain who can
challenge Ana's brilliance. But I was disappointed by the setting. {{
the_author }} made Yarrow much closer to high fantasy as a critique of the
genre's obsession with autocratic rulers, and this meant it lost some of the
biopunk weirdness that made {{ book1 }} so engaging. Ana and Din's
relationship also feels subdued, perhaps because they have reached a
equilibrium. This book also referenced some events from the first one, but
without enough context for me to remember what happened. It is tough to
balance reminding the reader, and over describing the last narrative, but I
would appreciated a little more hand-holding.

The major theme of {{ book1 }} was that a state is made up of its people, and
each has a responsibility to put in the work to maintain it. {{ this_book }}
continues that theme, but also focuses on the danger of authoritarian rulers.
The King of Yarrow is a slaver whose failures lead to the destruction of his
kingdom and people; the murderer---the pale king---is motivated not by
high minded ideals but common greed; and Thelenai, the ranking imperial, lets
pride lead her to taking risks with her people that create the murderer in the
first place.

I was reminded of a few previous reads:

- The court intrigue and an ancient monarch reminded my of {{ martines }} {{ empire
  }}.

- The three augurs reminded me a bit of the three witches in {{ shakespeares
  }}{{ macbeth }}, who in turn are inspired by the three fates.

- Ana eating her grim feast to gain knowledge reminds me of Severian eating
  Thecla's flesh to gain her memories in {{ wolfes }} {{ claw }}.

Although not as good as {{ book1 }}, I still had fun reading {{ this_book
  }}. I look forward to the forthcoming third book.
