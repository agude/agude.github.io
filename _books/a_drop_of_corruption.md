In {{ this_book }}, Din and Ana travel to the northern Kingdom of Yarrow to
solve the murder of a treasury officer. At first it looks like the officer was
abducted from his heavily guarded and locked room, but Din and Ana quickly
figure out that the man everyone thought was the official was actually the
murderer. They realize out that he has been planning to stop the flow of
reagents into the Empire by disrupting the Shroud, a special containment
structure in which leviathans are butchered.

I really enjoyed the mystery and the introduction of a villain who can
challenge Ana's mind. But I was disappointed by the setting. {{ the_author }}
made Yarrow much closer to high fantasy as a critique of the genre's obsession
with autocratic rulers, and this meant it lost some of the biopunk weirdness
that made {{ book1 }} so engaging. Ana and Din's relationship also feels
subdued, perhaps because they have reached a stable equilibrium. This book
referenced some events from the first one, but without enough context for me
to remember exactly what happened. It is tough to balance between reminding
the reader and over describing the last narrative, but it made my wonder if
things were being retconned, or if I had just forgotten.

The major theme of {{ book1 }} was that a state is made up of its people, and
each has a responsibility to put in the work to maintain it. {{ this_book }}
continues that theme, but also focuses on the danger of authoritarian rulers.
The King of Yarrow is a slaver whose failures lead to the destruction of his
kingdom and people; the murderer---the pale king---is motivated not by high
minded ideals but common greed; and Thelenai, the ranking imperial in the
area, lets pride lead her to taking risks with her people that create the
murderer in the first place.

In my review of {{ book1 }}, I said that it was a "Homesian detective story",
which isn't quite right: {{ the_author }} has clarified that he was inspired
by {{ stouts }} {{ nero_wolfe_series }}. Although I haven't read that series,
it is a close fit. Both Nero and Ana are armchair detectives whose
memory-enhanced partners do all the investigation. Clearly Ana isn't modeled
on Holmes, who traipsed about all over England and Europe investigating for
himself.[^mycroft] I may give the first {{ nero_wolfe_series }} book, {{ fdr
}}, a try soon.

[^mycroft]: Sherlock's older brother, Mycroft, _is_ an armchair detective.

I was reminded of a few previous reads:

- The court intrigue and an ancient monarch reminded my of {{ martines }} {{ empire
  }}.

- The three augurs reminded me a bit of the three witches in {{ shakespeares
  }}{{ macbeth }}, who in turn are inspired by the three fates.

- Ana eating her grim feast to gain knowledge reminds me of Severian eating
  Thecla's flesh to gain her memories in {{ wolfes }} {{ claw }}.

Although not as good as {{ book1 }}, I still had fun reading {{ this_book
  }}. I look forward to the forthcoming third book.
