<cite class="book-title">Night Without Stars</cite> is the second book in the
Chronicle of the Fallers. It is action packed, with great pacing, and complex
characters. It is my new favorite Hamilton book.

The plot continues 250 years after {% include book_link.html title="The Abyss
Beyond Dreams" %}. Planet Bienvenido escaped the Void but is now stranded in
intergalactic space. The promised Commonwealth rescue never came. Slvasta's
dictatorship morphed into a totalitarian, Soviet-style regime. The
[Stasi-modeled][stasi] People's Security Regiment (PSR) spend more time
plotting against each other than the Fallers.

The story follows PSR Captain Chaing as he oppresses his fellow humans and
tries to uncover nests of Fallers. When a Commonwealth ship falls from the
sky, Chaing tries to hunt down its clone passenger before she can disrupt the
balance of power on Bienvenido.

Chaing has depth: though at first he is acting against the protagonists who
are trying to help the Commonwealth clone, he cares deeply about saving the
world and defeating the Fallers. This leads him to start aiding the clone
while having to watch out for discovery by his fellow PSR members.

The Fallers are also much more interesting in this book. They are organized,
and they have used the fact that the humans are only on one continent to take
over the rest of the planet.

Unlike {% include book_link.html title="The Abyss Beyond Dreams" %}, <cite
class="book-title">Night Without Stars</cite> keeps a perfect pace, never
feeling too fast or too slow. It has a vast cast of interesting characters and
a satisfying resolution.
