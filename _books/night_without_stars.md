<span class="book-title">Night Without Stars</span>, is the second book in the
Chronicle of the Fallers. It's action packed, with great pacing, and complex
characters. It is my new favorite Hamilton book.

The plot continues 250 years after {% include book_link.html title="The Abyss
Beyond Dreams" %}. Planet Bienvenido escaped the Void but is now stranded in
intergalactic space. The promised Commonwealth rescue never came. Slvasta's
dictatorship has morphed into a totalitarian, Soviet-style government. The
People's Security Regiment (PSR)---modeled after the [Stasi][stasi]---spend
more time plotting against each other than the Fallers.

The story follows Captain Chaing of the SPR as he both oppresses both his
fellow humans and tries to hunt down nests of Fallers. Eventually a
Commonwealth ship falls from the sky and Chaing tries to hunt down its clone
passenger before she can disrupt the balance of power on Bienvenido.

Chaing is a complicated character: for most of the story he is acting against
the protagonists who are trying to help the Commonwealth clone.
But Chaing really does care about stopping the Fallers. This sees him slowly
start to work with, or at least not against, the rest of the cast of
characters.

The Fallers are also much more interesting in this book. They are more
organized, and they have used the fact that the humans are only on one
continent to take over the rest of the planet.

Unlike {% include book_link.html title="The Abyss Beyond Dreams" %}, <span
class="book-title">Night Without Stars</span> keeps a perfect pace, never
feeling too fast or too slow. It has a vast cast of interesting characters and
a satisfying resolution.
