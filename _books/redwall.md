<span class="book-title">Redwall</span> is the first book in the Redwall
series by Brian Jacques. It tells the story of Mathias the mouse as he follows
his destiny to become the abbey warrior and defeat the rat Cluny the Scourge.

I loved the Redwall series as a child and I am now getting the chance to read
them to my own children who are 6 and 7. Although the book is aimed at
children, not adults or even young-adults, I didn't find it annoying to read.
The themes are simple, the plot is uncomplicated, and in many ways it follows
typical quest narrative.

The morality in the book is black and white---the good guys are good and the
bad guys are bad and come to a bad end---but <span
class="book-title">Redwall</span> does not shy away from some more adult
themes. Death is a constant part of the narrative. The bad guys come to
gruesome ends and even the hero's friends aren't safe. I think we parents can
find this uneasy, wanting to shelter our children a bit, but my kids handled
it well and I know as a child I would have love the inclusion of topics I was
curious about but which people were hesitant to discuss.

I highly recommend <span class="book-title">Redwall</span> for new readers and
parents trying to get their kids hooked on books. My kids loved it so much
they begged me to read it at every hour of the day, and I didn't mind doing
so. When we finished the last chapter, we picked up the sequel {% include
