{{ this_book }} is actually the third book in the {{ series }}, but I read it
second. The second book, {{ critical }}, has no connection to the first book,
{{ mission }}, and only connects to {{ this_book }} through the character Easy
Hoffman and the concept of exploring a high-gravity planet.

In {{ this_book }}, the humans and the Mesklinites have once again teamed up,
this time to explore the planet Dhrawn, with the humans in space and the
Mesklinites on the planet in landships called cruisers. The cruiser
_Kwembly_---captained by the Dondragmer from {{ mission }}---gets stuck on an
outcropping and the humans and Mesklinites have to figure out how to rescue
it. This is made tougher by the fact that the Mesklinites, once again, have
their own, hidden motive.

The plot moves too slowly. The _Kwembly_ is stuck on the rock for
the entire book (well it gets down and is immediately re-stuck in ice). Like
{{ mission }}, {{ the_author }} intends to build tension not with the ship but
with the fact that the Mesklinites are working at cross purposes to the
humans. Again it fails to build tension and is resolved in a couple of pages
with the two sides talking it out.

One of {{ clements }} weaknesses in these two books is that he likes his
characters too much. He wants them to be good people, and he wants good things
to happen to them, so the potential backstabbing and betrayals are always
defused in a few paragraphs.

{{ the_author }} clearly heard the critique of {{ mission }} that his
characters were too human and added several digressions where he explains that
they think differently, and additionally adds some non-human behaviors like
not getting anxious or second guessing themselves. They still feel completely
human. Similarly, and just like {{ mission }}, the world didn't feel alien, in
the way that the neutron star did in the {{ cheela_series }}. I think this is
partially due to {{ clements }} philosophy of science fiction, that the main
fun is to come up with rules and try to stick with them, not necessarily to
immerse the reader.[^game]

In the end the book was fine, but slow going. I with more tension and tighter
editing I think it could have surpassed {{ mission }}, but as it stands it's
slightly worse.
