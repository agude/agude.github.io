<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a hard sci-fi story.

{{ this_book }} is the sequel to {{ mission }} and the third book in the {{
series }} series, although I read it second. The second book, {{ critical }},
does not share any characters with {{ mission }} and is only loosely connected
to the series, mainly by the character Easy Hoffman and the concept of
exploring a high-gravity planet.

In {{ this_book }}, the humans and the Mesklinites have once again teamed up,
this time to explore the planet Dhrawn, with the humans in space and the
Mesklinites on the planet in landships called cruisers. The cruiser
_Kwembly_---captained by the Dondragmer from {{ mission }}---gets stuck on an
outcropping and the humans and Mesklinites have to figure out how to rescue
it. This is made tougher by the fact that the Mesklinites, once again, have
their own motive.

In general the plot moves too slowly. The _Kwembly_ is stuck on the rock for
the entire book (well it gets down and is immediately re-stuck in ice). Like
{{ mission }}, {{ the_author }} intends to build tension not with the ship but
with the fact that the Mesklinites are working at cross purposes to the
humans, but again it fails to build tension and is resolved in a couple of
pages with the two sides talking it out.

One of {{ clements }} weaknesses in these two books is that he likes his
characters too much. He wants them to be good people, and he wants good things
to happen to them, so the potential backstabbing and betrayals are always
defused in a few paragraphs.

{{ the_author }} clearly heard the critique that his characters were too
human and added several digressions where he explains that they are not, and
additionally adds some non-human behavior like patience.

Like {{ mission }} I didn't really feel like the story took place on an alien
world. Yeah it's weird that water-ammonia mixtures freeze and thaw at weird
pressures and temperatures, but that wasn't really any different than if the
book had taken place in the snow. I think this comes down to {{ clements }}
style, in which following the self-imposed rules is the important part of hard
sci-fi.[^game]
