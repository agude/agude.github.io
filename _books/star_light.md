<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the sequel to {% book_link "Mission of Gravity" %}, and continues the theme of
Human--Mesklinite exploration, this time focusing on a large star-like planet.

{{ this_book }} is actually the third book in the {{ series }}, although I
read it second. The second book, {{ critical }}, has no direct connection to
{{ mission }}, and only links to {{ this_book }} through the character Easy
Hoffman and the concept of exploring a high-gravity planet.

In {{ this_book }}, humans and Mesklinites have once again joined forces, this
time to explore the planet Dhrawn. The humans remain in space while the
Mesklinites travel the planet's surface in landships called cruisers. The
story centers on the cruiser _Kwembly_---captained by Dondragmer from {{
mission }}---which becomes stuck on an outcropping. Both humans and
Mesklinites must work together to rescue it, a task complicated by the
Mesklinites's hidden agenda.

The plot progresses slowly. The _Kwembly_ remains stuck for most of the book
(it briefly gets free only to become trapped in ice). Similar to {{ mission
}}, {{ the_author }} attempts to build tension through the conflicting motives
of the Mesklinites and humans. However, this tension never really builds and
is quickly resolved through dialogue in just a few pages in the last chapter.

One of {{ clements }} weaknesses in these two books is that he likes his
characters too much. He wants them to be good people, and he wants good things
to happen to them, so the potential backstabbing and betrayals _that would add
tension_ are always defused in a few paragraphs.

{{ the_author }} attempted to address the critique of {{ mission }}---that his
Mesklinite characters were too human---by having several digressions where he
explains that Mesklinites think differently than humans do. He also added some
non-human behaviors like not getting anxious or second guessing themselves.
They still feel completely human.

Similarly, and just like {{ mission }}, the world didn't feel alien,
especially when compared to the neutron star in the {{ cheela_series }}. This
may be partly due to {{ clements }} philosophy of science fiction, in which it
is important to establish and stick to scientific rules rather than immersing
the reader.[^game]

In the end the book was fine, but slow going. With more tension and tighter
editing I think it could have surpassed {{ mission }}, but as it stands it's
slightly worse.
