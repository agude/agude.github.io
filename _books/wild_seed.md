<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is the first book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series, though it was the
fourth to be published. It tells the origin story of Doro---a malevolent
spirit---and Anyanwu---an immortal woman.

Doro and Anyanwu are almost opposites. Despite his ability to change bodies
and her ability to change shape, Doro is male, while Anyanwu is female. He
kills for pleasure and survival, whereas she is a healer. Doro collects
superhumans to serve his goals, while Anyanwu protects them. Yet their shared
immortality keeps pulling them together, even as their conflicting goals and
personalities push them apart. Anyanwu is the only one who won't die and leave
Doro alone, and she may be the only one capable of tempering his monstrous
nature. In many ways, {{ this_book }} is their love story.[^enemies]

[^enemies]:
    [Emily Fox][fox] jokingly referred to {{ this_book }} as "[...]the worst
    enemies to lovers I've read in a while..." which is not inaccurate!

{{ this_authors }} settings are incredibly sparse, giving the book the feel of
a stage play with rough-painted backdrops that are just enough to suggest a
location: "a ship", "a village in New York", or "a plantation". Often, her
settings aren't described at all. This is in stark contrast to {{ banks }},
whose {{ culture_series }} I read just before this. He builds richly detailed
places, like the ancient city and waterfall in {{ c7 }} for his stories. The
effect is perfect for this story though, as---like a play!---it focuses the
attention on the characters and the dialogue.

The story has strong Christian themes, essentially functioning as a Genesis
story. Doro, a god-like figure, is creating his own people. His favored son is
named Isaac. The section titles directly reference biblical themes:

- [The Covenant][covenant]: Doro, as god, makes a pact with Anyanwu, agreeing
  not to harm her children if she joins him.

- [Lot][lot]: Like Lot fleeing God's wrath, Anyanwu escapes Doro. The
  incestuous relationship between Lot and his daughters parallels Doro's
  breeding program.

- [Canaan][canaan]: The promised land for God's people becomes Anyanwu's
  plantation sanctuary in the story.

{{ this_book }} is also an [Atlantic slave trade][slave] story. Doro captures
Anyanwu in Africa and traffics her across the ocean to his colonies in
America. Many of Doro's people are literal African slaves he purchases for
their powers. Regardless of their origin, Doro treats all his people as
slaves, controlling them with violence and breeding them to suit his own ends.

{{ this_authors }} characters really got into my head. I **hated** Doro and
couldn't understand what Anyanwu saw in him. But by the end, I felt sorry for
Doro as he feared losing Anyanwu forever. I'm eager to see how his character
evolves in the next book, {{ p2 }}.
