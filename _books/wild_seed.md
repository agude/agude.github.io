<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>, is the first book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series, though it was the
fourth to be published. It tells the origin story of Doro---a malevolent
spirit---and Anyanwu---an immortal woman.

Doro and Anyanwu are almost opposites: despite being able to change bodies and
shape, Doro is male and Anyanwu is female; he kills for pleasure and to keep
himself alive and she is a healer; Doro is collecting super humans for his own
ends and Anyanwu is doing so to protect them. But the thing they have in
common---that they are both immortal---keeps drawing them back together even
as their opposed goals and personalities push them apart: Anyanwu is the only
person who won't leave Doro alone, and she is the only person who has a chance
to mute his abominable nature. In many ways, {{ this_book }} is their love
story.[^enemies]

[^enemies]:
    [Emily Fox][fox] joking referred to {{ this_book }} as "[...]the worst
    enemies to lovers I've read in a while..." which is not inaccurate!

{{ this_authors }} settings are incredible sparse, which makes the book feel
like a stage play with just a rough painted backdrop to give the reader a hint
of the location. Often her settings aren't even described at all, they are
simply "a ship", "a village in New York", "a plantation". This is in stark
contrast to {{ banks }}---whose {{ culture_series }} I read just before
this---who builds very detailed places, like the ancient city and waterfall in
{{ c7 }} for his stories to take place in. The effect is perfect though,
as---like a play!---it focuses the attention on the characters and the
dialogue, which are where this book shines.

The story has strong Christian themes, as it is essentially a Genesis story:
Doro, an almost god-like figure, is creating his own people. His favored son
is Isaac. The section titles of the book reference:

- [The Covenant][covenant]: Doro, as god, strikes an agreement with Anyanwu
  not to hurt her children in exchange for her joining him.

- [Lot][lot]: Lot's flees God's wrath as Anyanwu flees Doro, and the
  incestuous relationship with Lot's daughters mirrors the incestuous breeding
  program Doro is pursuing.

- [Canaan][canaan]: A promised land for God's people, in {{ this_book }} it is
  Anyanwu's plantation sanctuary.

{{ this_book }} is also an [Atlantic slave trade][slave] story. Doro captures
Anyanwu in Africa and traffics her across the ocean to his colonies in
America. Many of Doro's people are literally African slaves he buys for their
powers. Doro treats his people---regardless of their background---as slaves,
coercing them to follow him through violence and breeding them for his own
profit.

{{ this_authors }} characters really stuck with me. I **hated** Doro, and
didn't understand what Anyanwu saw in him, but by the end of the book I felt
sorry for Doro as he feared losing Anyanwu forever. I'm looking forward to see
how he changes in the next book, {{ p2 }}.
