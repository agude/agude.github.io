<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the forth book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It starts a new
storyline, and changes the way the stories are told.

The thing I loved about the previous three {{ bobiverse }} books---{{ bob1 }},
{{ bob2 }}, and {{ bob3 }}---was how many interweaving stories they told. The
chapters where very short, often just a few minutes to read, and each new one
changed point of view and story. This kept the book moving fast.

{{ this_book }} does away with that almost completely. There is only one
story, subsequent chapters stay with the same character and storyline, and the
chapters are much longer; some take over 30 minutes to read! The book is also
twice as long as any of the previous ones. This made the book feel slow.

At first it seems there are several stories:

- The search for Bender within Heaven's River, an alien [Topopolis][wiki_top].
- The fracturing of the Bobiverse, like the Gamers,[^game_cringe] the AI
  developing Skippies, and the isolationist Star Fleet.
- The exodus of some Bobs to the far reaches of the Galaxy.

[^game_cringe]:
    Not quite as "overly cute" as the MMORPG-guilds-turned-mercenary Zokus
    from {{ quantum }}, but close.

The first two storylines are actually the same story: the fracturing is
accelerated by the contact with the Quinlans in the Topopolis. And the third
storyline doesn't really take off, obviously being saved for later books.

Overall, the speed and multiple storylines is what I like most about {{
bobiverse }}, and this book does away with both. Still fun, but less so.
