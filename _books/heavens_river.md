<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the forth book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It changes not only
the subject of the story compared to the previous three, but the way it is
told.

The thing I loved about previous three {{ bobiverse }} books---{{ bob1 }}, {{
bob2 }}, and {{ bob3 }}---was how many interweaving stories they told, and how
fast those stories moved. Chapters were often very short, just a few minutes
to read, and each chapter changed point of view and story. {{ this_book }}
does away with that almost completely. There is only one story, subsequent
chapters stay with the same character and storyline, and the chapters are much
longer. Some chapters take over 30 minutes to read, whereas most chapters in
the previous books were about 5 minutes. The book is twice as long as the
previous ones. This made the whole thing feel slow.

At first it seems there are several stories:

- The search for Bender within Heaven's River, an alien [Topopolis][wiki_top].
- The fracturing of the Bobiverse into factions, like the
  Gamers,[^game_cringe] AI developing Skippies, and the isolationist Star
  Fleet.
- The exodus of some Bobs to the far reaches of the Galaxy.

[^game_cringe]:
    Not quite as "overly cute" as the MMORPG-guilds-turned-mercenary Zokus
    from {{ quantum }}, but close.

But it turns out these are all the same story. Initially these stories didn't
really hold my interest, but
