<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the fourth book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It starts a new
storyline and changes the way the stories are told.

What I loved about the previous three {{ bobiverse }} books---{{ bob1 }},
{{ bob2 }}, and {{ bob3 }}---was how many interweaving stories they told. The
chapters were very short, often just a few minutes to read, and each new one
changed point of view and story. This kept the books moving fast.

{{ this_book }} does away with that almost completely. There is only one
story, subsequent chapters stay with the same character and storyline, and the
chapters are much longer; some take over 30 minutes to read! The book is also
twice as long as any of the previous ones. This made reading the book feel
slow.

This book also ends the geek-power fantasy that was core to the series.
Previously, Bob was a kind-hearted nerd who overcame all obstacles in his path
by being clever. In {{ this_book }}, a lot has gone wrong and the Bobs are
powerless to stop it: the Pav are hostile, the humans want to separate from
the Bobiverse, and the Bobiverse is breaking down into
factions---gamers[^game_cringe], AI-obsessed Skippies, and isolationist
Starfleet---while Bob himself is stuck on an alien [topopolis][wiki_top].

[^game_cringe]:
    Not quite as "overly cute" as the MMORPG-guilds-turned-mercenary Zokus
    from {{ quantum }}, but close.

All the apparent storylines turn out to be just one story: the exploration of
the Quinlan topopolis to rescue Bender, which accelerates the fracturing of
the Bobiverse. The actual investigation of the megastructure and the escape
from the various groups trying to capture Bob was exciting to read, and
several of the new characters introduced in those chapters are interesting,
like Anek-23 and Theresa. But the Bobiverse factions part of the story did
not interest me. It makes me worried about how I'll like {{ bob5 }}, which I
think will explore the splintering more.

Overall, the speed and multiple storylines are what I like most about {{
bobiverse }}, and this book does away with both. Still fun, but less so.
