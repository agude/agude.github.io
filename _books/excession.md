<span class="book-title">Excession</span> is the fourth novel and fifth book
in the Culture series. It follows the reaction of the Culture and other
civilizations to an "excession": an _"Outside Context Problem"_ that is
mysterious and enormously powerful.

The best part of the novel was getting to see how the Culture _works_: how the
minds think, communicate with each other, make decisions, retreat to "infinite
fun space", and interact with an _"Outside Context Problem"_[^ocp]. The worst
part of the book was the human characters, who were shallow and uninteresting.
Ulver Seich---the airhead socialite---is a slightly more interesting and
better-written take on the "hot girl who fucks her way through the narrative"
trope that {% include author_link.html name="Peter F. Hamilton" %} loves to
write, such as Mellanie Rescorai in {% include book_link.html title="Pandora's Star" %},
or to a lesser extent, Kysandra Blair in
{% include book_link.html title="The Abyss Beyond Dreams" %}. Nonetheless, I
dreaded the human chapters. Culture books are carried by their human
characters, who bring scale, emotion, and stakes to the drama, and <span
class="book-title">Excession</span>'s humans fall short.

The story wasn't what I expected. I anticipated a book about how the Culture
deals with something---the excession---over which they have no control, but
the plot was actually about how they would exploit it for their schemes. The
book is rife with schemes: one to disguise the nature of the _Sleeper
Service_; another to set up a false-flag operation to build support for a
Culture war against the Nazi-like jellyfish race, the Affront; a third to
reunite Dajeil Gelian and Byr Genar-Hofoen and reconcile their relationship;
and a fourth to intercept Genar-Hofoen with Siech and prevent him from
rendezvousing with the _Sleeper Service_.

Even after reading such "tricky" books as
{% include book_link.html title="The Quantum Thief" %} and {% include
book_link.html title="The Shadow of the Torturer" %}, I found <span
class="book-title">Excession</span> a little challenging, mainly because of
the numerous ships to keep track of while also trying to discern which ones
were the conspirators.

Some aspects I loved:

- The Mind IRC chats.
- The glacial genocide uncovered by the _Grey Area_.
- The Affront, a jellyfish-like race modeled after the British Colonial Empire
  and the Nazis.
- The drone that embeds an SOS message onto an enemy ship using blast craters.
- The human-body BIOS that allows the brain to control everything from muscle
  density to gender.

Overall, <span class="book-title">Excession</span> is still a good book, but
weaker compared to {% include book_link.html title="The Player of Games" %}
and {% include book_link.html title="Use of Weapons" %}.
