<span class="book-title">Excession</span> is the forth novel and fifth book in
the Culture series. It follows the reaction of the Culture and other
civilizations to an "excession": an _"Outside Context Problem"_[^ocp] that is
mysterious and enormously powerful.

The best part of the novel was getting to see how the Culture _works_: how the
minds think, how they talk to each other, how they make decisions, how they
retreat to "infinite fun space". The worst part of the book was the human
characters, who were shallow and uninteresting. Ulver Seich---the airhead
socialite---is at least a slightly more interesting and well written take on
the "hot girl who fucks her way through the narrative" that {% include
author_link.html name="Peter F. Hamilton" %} loves to write: see Mellanie
Rescorai in {% include book_link.html title="Pandora's Star" %}, or less
egregiously Kysandra Blair in
{% include book_link.html title="The Abyss Beyond Dreams" %}; but even so I
dreaded the human chapters. Culture books are carried by their human
characters. They are what bring scale, emotion, and stakes to the drama, and
<span class="book-title">Excession</span>'s humans disappointed.

The story was not what I expected. I expected a book about how the Culture
deals with something---the excession---that they have no power over, but the
plot was actually about how they would use it in their schemes. And schemes
there are aplenty in the book. There is a scheme to disguise the nature of the
_Sleeper Service_; a second to set up a false-flag operation to build support
for a Culture war against the Nazi-jellyfish, the Affront; a third to bring
Dajeil Gelian and Byr Genar-Hofoen back together to reconcile their
relationship; and a forth to intercept Genar-Hofoen with Siech and prevent him
from rendezvousing with the _Sleeper Service_.

Even after reading such "tricky" books as {% include book_link.html title="The Quantum Thief" %} and
{% include book_link.html title="The Shadow of the Torturer" %}, I found
<span class="book-title">Excession</span> a little tough just because there
are so many ships to keep track of while also trying to figure out which are
the conspirators.

Some parts I loved:

- The mind IRC chats.
- The glacial genocide uncovered by the _Grey Area_.
- The Affront, a race of jellyfish modeled after the British Colonial Empire
  and the Nazis.
- The drone that uses blast craters to embed an SOS message onto an enemy ship.
- The human-body BIOS that allows the brain to control everything from muscle
  density to gender.

Overall still a good book, but weak compared to {% include book_link.html title="The Player of Games" %}
and {% include book_link.html title="Use of Weapons" %}.
