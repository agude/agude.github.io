<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>, is the fourth novel and
fifth book in the <span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series.
It follows the reaction of the Culture and other civilizations to an
"excession": an _"Outside Context Problem"_---something mysterious,
unpredictable, and enormously powerful.

The best part of the novel is getting to see how the Culture _works_: how the
Minds think, communicate, make decisions, retreat to "Infinite Fun Space," and
interact with an _Outside Context Problem_.[^ocp] The worst part was the human
characters---shallow and uninteresting. Ulver Seich, the airhead socialite, is
a slightly more engaging and better-written take on the "hot girl who sleeps
her way through the narrative" trope that {{ hamiltons }} loves to use, like
Mellanie Rescorai in {{ pandoras_star }} or, to a lesser extent, Kysandra
Blair in {{ abyss_dreams }}. Even so, I dreaded the human-focused chapters.
Culture books rely on their human characters to bring scale, emotion, and
stakes to the drama, and {{ this_book }}'s humans fall short.

The story wasn't what I expected. I thought the book would explore how the
Culture deals with something beyond their control. Instead, it's about how
they try to _exploit_ the excession for their own schemes. And the book is
full of them: one to disguise the nature of the _Sleeper Service_; another to
stage a false-flag operation to justify a war against the Nazi-like Affront; a
third to reunite Dajeil Gelian and Byr Genar-Hofoen; and a fourth to intercept
Genar-Hofoen with Seich to keep him from reaching the _Sleeper Service_.

Even after reading "tricky" books like {{ quantum_thief }} and {{
shadow_torturer }}, I found {{ this_book }} a challenge---mainly because of
the sheer number of ships to track while also trying to figure out which ones
were part of the conspiracy.

Some aspects I loved:

- The Mind IRC-style chats.
- The glacial genocide uncovered by the _Grey Area_.
- The Affront, a jellyfish-like race modeled after the British Empire and the
  Nazis.
- The drone that embeds an SOS message onto an enemy ship using blast craters.
- The human-body BIOS that lets people control everything from muscle density
  to gender.

Overall, {{ this_book }} is still a good book, but weaker than {{ player_games
}} and {{ use_weapons }}.
