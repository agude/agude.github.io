<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is the fourth novel and
fifth book in the <span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series.
It follows the reaction of the Culture and other civilizations to an
"excession": an _"Outside Context Problem"_---something mysterious,
unpredictable, and enormously powerful.

The best part of the novel is getting to see how the Culture _works_: how the
Minds think, communicate, make decisions, retreat to "Infinite Fun Space", and
interact with an _Outside Context Problem_.[^ocp] The worst part was the human
characters---shallow and uninteresting. Ulver Seich, the airhead socialite, is
a slightly more engaging and better-written take on the "hot girl who sleeps
her way through the narrative" trope that {{ hamiltons }} loves to use, like
Mellanie Rescorai in {{ pandoras_star }} or, to a lesser extent, Kysandra
Blair in {{ abyss_dreams }}. Even so, I dreaded the human-focused chapters.
Culture books rely on their human characters to bring scale, emotion, and
stakes to the drama, and {{ this_book }}'s humans fall short.

The story wasn't what I expected. I thought the book would explore how the
Culture deals with something beyond their control. Instead, it's about how
they try to _exploit_ the Excession for their own schemes. And the book is
full of schemes: one to disguise the nature of the _Sleeper Service_; another
to stage a false-flag operation to justify war against the Nazi-like Affront;
a third to reunite Dajeil Gelian and Byr Genar-Hofoen; and a fourth to
intercept Genar-Hofoen with Seich to keep him from reaching the _Sleeper
Service_.

One major theme is duality. The Affront's cartoonish cruelty is set against
the Culture's carefully curated image of peace and Utopian existence. behavior
is paired with the peaceful, utopian Culture. The interventionist _Grey Area_
is mirrored by  the isolationist _Sleeper Service_. Genar-Hofoen engages
wildly with the universe; Dajeil Gelian withdraws. Ulver Seich is a
self-absorbed hedonist; Gestra Ishmethit is an ascetic hermit. The Excession
itself has no counterpart, which drives home its alienness: it doesn't _fit_
into any context.

Even after reading so-called "hard" books like {{ quantum_thief }} or {{
shadow_torturer }}, I still found {{ this_book }} hard to track---mostly
because of the flood of ship names and trying to figure out who was in on
what.

Some aspects I loved:

- The Minds' IRC-style chats.

- The glacial genocide uncovered by the _Grey Area_.

- The Affront, a jellyfish-like race modeled after the British Empire and the
  Nazis.

- The drone that embeds an SOS message onto an enemy ship using blast craters.

- The human-body BIOS that lets people control everything from muscle density
  to gender.

Overall, {{ this_book }} is still a good book, but weaker than {{
player_games }} and {{ use_weapons }}.
