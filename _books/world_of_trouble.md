{{ this_book }} suffers from the same problems as {{ lp2 }}: it focuses too
much on the present at the expense of the past. But even in the present there
is an interesting idea about how different towns handle the end of the
world: green towns pretend everything is fine, red towns are total
chaos, blue towns are populated but everyone is hiding, etc. But this too goes
mostly unexplored. I wanted to experience the different types of towns, and
instead they were just mentioned.

The mystery Palace is solving this time is the murder of his sister, which
does a good job of tying together the overarching Nico-saves-the-world plot
line with the mystery in each book. We learn that Nico's rebels aren't saving
the world, they're on a carefully curated snipe hunt <!-- Is snipe hunt the
best word choice? --> put together by the FBI to distract some hardened
criminals and prevent them from causing havock as the world ends. This
explains the helicopter, the missions, the secret documents.

In the end there were some engaging scense, like stumbling upon the Amish, and
the couple raising chickens in their camper, but the myster was so-so. I'm
glad the series is over as it seemed to drift more and more as it went on.
