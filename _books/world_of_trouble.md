<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>, is the third and final
novel in the <span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It
follows Detective Palace as he discovers what his sister has been involved in
just days before the world ends.

{{ this_book }} suffers from the same problems as {{ lpm2 }}: it focuses too
much on the present at the expense of the past. But even in the present there
are interesting ideas that aren't fleshed out enough, like how different towns
handle the end of the world: green towns pretend everything is fine, red towns
are total chaos, blue towns are populated but everyone is hiding, etc. I
wanted to experience the different types of towns, and instead they were just
mentioned.

The mystery Palace is solving this time is the murder of his sister, which
does a good job of tying together the overarching Nico-saves-the-world plot
line with the smaller mystery solved in each book. We learn that Nico's rebels
aren't saving the world, they're on a carefully curated snipe hunt <!-- Is
snipe hunt the best word choice? --> put together by the FBI to distract some
hardened criminals and prevent them from causing havoc as the world ends. This
explains the helicopter, the missions, and the secret documents.

In the end there were some engaging scenes, like stumbling upon the Amish, and
the couple raising chickens in their camper, but the mystery and world
building were so-so. I'm excited to move on from this series, that started
with so much promise in {{ lpm1 }} but couldn't deliver.
