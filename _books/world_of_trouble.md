<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is the third and final
novel in the <span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It
follows Detective Palace as he uncovers his sister's involvement in a
mysterious plot just days before the world's end.

{{ this_book }} shares the same weakness as {{ lpm2 }}: it focuses too heavily
on the present at the expense of the past. Even within the present-day
narrative, there are ideas that aren't fully explored, such as how different
towns handle the end of the world: green towns pretend everything is fine, red
towns are total chaos, blue towns are populated but everyone is hiding, etc. I
wanted to experience the different types of towns, and instead they were just
mentioned.

The central mystery in this installment revolves around the murder of Palace's
sister, effectively tying together the overarching Nico-saves-the-world
plotline with the individual mysteries of each book. We learn that Nico's
rebel group isn't actually saving the world; instead, they're unwitting
participants in an elaborate FBI scheme designed to keep dangerous criminals
occupied and prevent widespread chaos as the world approaches its end. This
revelation explains the presence of the helicopter, the mysterious missions,
and the secret documents.

While the book has some engaging scenes, such as the encounter with the Amish
community and the couple raising chickens in their camper, the mystery and
world-building aspects fall short. The series, which began with such promise
in {{ lpm1 }}, ultimately fails to deliver on its potential. I'm glad to move
on.
