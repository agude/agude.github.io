<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is a Hugo Award-winning
novelette about the obsolescence of the human artist. It follows Ryan
Thornier, a former matinee idol reduced to working as a janitor in a theater
now run entirely by androids and an AI director, as he schemes to take the
stage one last time.

In {{ this_book }}, actors have been replaced on the stage by robots. An AI
Maestro controls them and adapts the works on the fly to the audience's
reactions. Human actors are reduced to a novelty, only used out in the sticks
as a lark. Audiences prefer the robotic plays because they are easier to
understand and less challenging to their points of view. Against this
backdrop, three former actors---Ryan Thornier, Mela Stone, and Jade
Ferne---try to figure out what to do with their lives.

Thornier is obsessed with his former life, and is reduced to mopping the
floors of the theater in a big to stay close to the stage. When he grows tired
of it, and is on the verge of being replaced by again by a robot, he plots a
way to have one last chance in the limelight when the theater puts on a
robotic version of the last play he acted in.

Stone has accepted the complete commercialization of her art. She sells her
personality rights, allowing robots to be made in her image. Ferne was never
popular enough to be offered that kind of contract, so she instead works
producing robotic plays.

I was expecting {{ the_authors_lastname }}, as an artist, to take Thornier's
side. But he doesn't, not really. He portrays Thornier as driven by vanity and
fighting hopelessly against an inevitability. And his inability to move on,
and respond to the audience, makes him more machine-like than the Maestro. Nor
does he condemn Stone and Ferne as collaborators. Even the robots and their
creator aren't the villains. If there is anyone at fault, it is the audience
that has learned to prefer unchallenging robots. But there too {{
the_authors_lastname }} admits that is the way it should be in commercial art.
If anything, it is the economics that are at fault.

At the end, the author argues that specialists are doomed to be replaced. The
only one that isn't is the specialist that creates new specialties
continuously. As his character Rick says: "The specialty of creating new
specialties. Continuously. Your own. [...] More or less a definition of Man,
isn't it?" It reminds me of {{ heinleins_lastname }} quote from {{
time_enough_for_love }}:

> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a
> hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build
> a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate,
> act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a
> computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.
> Specialization is for insects.

Although {{ the_authors_lastname }} is arguing more for specializing in being
yourself, while {{ heinlein_lastname }} argues for generalization, both have
identified stagnation as the problem.

In science fiction, I often see works that predict robots replacing manual
labor, or AI taking over numerical jobs. But a common conceit is that what
makes humans unique is our creativity. {{ this_book }} is interesting in that
it instead proposes that that creative work might infact be what we automate.
That's the actuality that seems all the more possible today with the rise of
[generative AI][gen_ai], and the [push back it is getting from
artists][ai_art]. It's a theme addressed in a few other places: {{
dahls_lastname }} {{ grammatizator }}, {{ leibers_lastname }} {{
the_silver_eggheads }}, {{ lems_lastname }} {{ trurls_electronic_bard }}, {{
ballards_lastname }} {{ studio_5_the_stars }}, and {{ vonneguts_lastname }} {{
player_piano }}. If we instead think of commercialization of art, we saw that
with Silenus's <cite class="book-title">Cantos</cite> flopping while his <cite
class="book-title">The Dying Earth</cite> sold billions in {{
simmonss_lastname }} {{ hyperion }}.

{{ this_book }} is named after the neologism "Darfsteller", which is probably
a portmanteau of the German words "Darsteller" for "actor" and "Darf" meaning
"allowed to". In the book it means roughly a method actor who must internalize
the role to play it and can't be given outside direction. It is paired against
the "Schauspieler", also a German word meaning roughly "actor", who is
directed how to act. It serves as a linguistic focus for main tension in the
plot: what role humans still have in art when a machine can do their job
better.

[wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Darfsteller

{{ the_authors_lastname_possessive }} answer is: for commercial art, what
makes money is what will win. That no single person can fight against the
tide, and that they will each do what they think they need to to survive.
