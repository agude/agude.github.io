{{ this_book }} did a great job of building a mood within me, using its prose
and characters to shape how I was feeling, to make me remember what it was like
to fall in love. But once I finished it, that feeling collapsed and the book
kind of disappeared from my mind. That's not what normally happens. Most of the
time I think about a book for days after I finish it, and for some rare
ones---{{ the_book_of_the_new_sun }}, {{ firefall }}, and the {{ culture
}}---years.

I think that's because {{ this_book }} relies so heavily on the relationship,
and intentionally hollows out the setting to bring Red and Blue into sharp
focus. You don't need to know much about the war, about the Agency or Garden,
or about the logic of their current missions, because it is all pointless. The
war is unending. It can't be won. The _only_ thing that matters is the
feelings Red and Blue have for each other.

In that way, {{ this_book }} is kind of the structural opposite of the {{
jean_le_flambeur }} series and {{ house_of_suns }}. Those books were almost
entirely carried by elaborate worldbuilding, where the characters, the plot,
and even the writing were less important than the novelty of the setting. They
suffered heavily for it. This book does away with most of the setting and plot
to focus entirely on the characters and the prose. It works better, but it
still leaves the book feeling a little incomplete. Those books are all brain,
this book is all soul; you need both.

{{ this_book }} also references a lot of other works: {{ mitchisons_lastname
}} {{ travel_light }}, {{ joyces_lastname }} {{ ulysses }}, {{ homers }} {{
the_odyssey }}, {{ shelleys_lastname }} {{ ozymandias }}, {{ yeatss_lastname
}} {{ the_second_coming }}, and {{ keatss_lastname }}'s epitaph (also heavily
referenced by {{ simmons }} in {{ hyperion }}).

The prose in {{ this_book }} reminded me of {{ martines_lastname }} {{
a_memory_called_empire }}. The constant references to pop culture felt like {{
clines_lastname }} {{ ready_player_one }}. The secret war that most people are
oblivious to was similar to {{ qntms }} {{ there_is_no_antimemetics_division
}}. The fighting through time was like the Shrike and Moneta in {{
simmonss_lastname }} {{ hyperion }}. The wide variety of combat methods and
settings reminded me of {{ use_of_weapons }} and {{ surface_detail }}. Blue
going undercover as an apothecary was like {{ inversions }}, and the authors'
use of wild settings reminded me of how {{ banks_lastname }} uses places in
the {{ culture }} series in general. The letter that kills reminded me of the
Bene Gesserit and their power words in {{ herberts_lastname }} {{ dune }}. Red
being able to disable part of herself so her controllers wouldn't know what
she's doing is like Murderbot from {{ wellss_lastname }} {{
the_murderbot_diaries }}.
 
Next up is {{ hyperion2 }}, {{ hyperion3 }}, and {{ hyperion4 }}. I put off
finishing the series the last time I read it, but this time I'm going to make
it through. I've already started my re-read of {{ hyperion2 }}, and it's even
better than I remember. I'm excited to see where the series goes.
