<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a short story that serves
as a bridge between {% include book_link.html title="Blindsight" %} and {%
include book_link.html title="Echopraxia" %}. It follows Colonel Keaton---the
father of Siri Keaton---as he investigates whether the Bicameral hivemind
poses a threat to baseline humans.

The story is very short, less than 40 pages, and acts more like a prologue to
{{ echopraxia }}. It begins with a hivemind attack on a remote geoengineering
site, which prompts the colonel's investigation of the Bicameral hivemind and
his final decision to join them in the deserts of Oregon.

One of the strongest aspects of {{ wattss }} Firefall series is the
world-building, and {{ this_book }} packs in a lot of detail for such a short
story: the concept of hiveminds from {{ blindsight }} is expanded upon; we
glimpse geoengineering, AI-controlled weapons, people with bioengineered
brains, and even a quaint restaurant in LA where the food is still prepared
and served by humans.

I was initially hesitant to dive into {{ echopraxia }} because many readers
who loved {{ blindsight }} disliked it, but {{ this_book }} made me eager to
continue the series.
