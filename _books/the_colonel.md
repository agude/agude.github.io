<cite class="book-title">The Colonel</cite> is a short story that acts as a
bridge between {% include book_link.html title="Blindsight" %} and {% include
book_link.html title="Echopraxia" %}. It follows Colonel Keaton---father of
Siri Keaton---as he tries to determine if the Bicameral hivemind is a threat
to baseline humans.

The story is very short, less than 40 pages, and really is more like a
prologue to {% include book_link.html title="Echopraxia" %}. It starts with a
hivemind attack on a remote geoengineering site followed by the colonel's
investigation of the Bicameral hivemind and final decision to join them in the
deserts of Oregon.

Watts's world building is one of the best parts his Firefall series, and this
book packs in a lot: the concept of hiveminds from {% include book_link.html
title="Blindsight" %} is expanded on; we see glimpses of geoengineering, AI
controlled weapons, people with bioengineered brains, and even a quaint
restaurant in LA where the food is still cooked and served by humans.

I was a little hesitant to jump into {% include book_link.html
title="Echopraxia" %} because so many people who loved {% include
book_link.html title="Blindsight" %} dislike it, but <cite
class="book-title">The Colonel</cite> made me eager to jump right in again.
