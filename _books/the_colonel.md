<cite class="book-title">The Colonel</cite> is a short story that serves as a
bridge between {% include book_link.html title="Blindsight" %} and {% include
book_link.html title="Echopraxia" %}. It follows Colonel Keaton---the father of
Siri Keaton---as he investigates whether the Bicameral hivemind poses a threat
to baseline humans.

The story is very short, less than 40 pages, and acts more like a prologue to
{% include book_link.html title="Echopraxia" %}. It begin with a hivemind
attack on a remote geoengineering site, which prompts the colonel's
investigation of the Bicameral hivemind and his final decision to join them in
the deserts of Oregon.

One of the strongest aspects of Watts's Firefall series is the world-building,
and <cite class="book-title">The Colonel</cite> packs in a lot of detail for
such a short story: the concept of hiveminds from {% include book_link.html
title="Blindsight" %} is expanded upon; we glimpse geoengineering,
AI-controlled weapons, people with bioengineered brains, and even a quaint
restaurant in LA where the food is still prepared and served by humans.

I was initially hesitant to dive into {% include book_link.html
title="Echopraxia" %} because many readers who loved {% include book_link.html
title="Blindsight" %} disliked it, but <cite class="book-title">The
Colonel</cite> made me eager to continue the series.
