Flatland tells the story of A Square, who is a square living in a
two-dimensional world. The first part of the book explains how Square's world
and society work, while the second part has Square visit other worlds with
different numbers of dimensions.

The social part of the book is pretty heavy-handed satire, so much so that I,
who has only a passing familiarity with Victorian life, can see what they're
satirizing. The primary fact of Flatland society is that your shape, which is
determined at birth, dictates your entire life, just as the social hierarchy
in Victorian England was based mostly on your birth.

The geometry part of the book---where Square visits Lineland (1D), Spaceland
(3D), and Pointland (0D)---is eye opening in how it makes you think about
geometry. A fun part is that each N-dimensional being finds N-1 dimensions to
be trivial, their own N-dimensional world to be the obvious limit on the
number of dimension, and N+1 to be crazy. When Square works out through
induction the existence of 4th and 5th dimensional worlds, his 3D
guide---Sphere---rejects it immediately.

After reading it seems so simple to imagine that I can picture a hyper cube
just by saying "Upward, not Northward." But alas I'm stuck with my standard
method of visualizing N-dimensions: thinking of 3D and saying to myself
"N-dimension, N-dimensions!" over and over again.[^apologies]

[^apologies]: I stole this from someone, but I couldn't find the source.

The book is short, the setting is fun, and the geometry primer is informative.
The social commentary is of course dated, but the geometry part is as fresh as
ever.
