Flatland tells the story of A Square. He is a square living in a
two-dimensional world. The first part of the book explains how Square's world
and society work, while the second part has Square visit other worlds with
different numbers of dimensions.

The social part of the book is pretty heavy-handed satire, so much so that I,
who has only a passing familiarity with Victorian life, can see what they're
getting at. The prime fact of Flatland is that your shape, which is determined
at birth, dictates your entire life, just as the social hierarchy in Victorian
England was based mostly on your birth.

The geometry part of the book---where Square visits Lineland (1D), Spaceland
(3D), and Pointland (0D)---is eye opening in how it makes you think about
geometry. A fun part is that each N-dimensional being finds N-1 dimensions to
be trivial, their own N-dimensional world to be the obvious limit on the
number of dimension, and N+1 to be crazy. When Square works out through
induction the existence of 4th and 5th dimensional worlds, his 3D
guide---Sphere---rejects it immediately.

The book is short, the setting is fun, and the geometry primer is informative.
