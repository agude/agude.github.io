{{ this_book }} tells the story of A Square, who is a square living in a
two-dimensional world. The first part of the book explains how Square's world
and society work, while the second part chronicles Square's visits
to worlds with different dimensions.

The social commentary is a heavy-handed satire, so much so that even someone
with only a passing familiarity with Victorian life can see what they're
satirizing. The primary fact of Flatland society is that your shape, which is
determined at birth, dictates your entire life, just as the social hierarchy
in Victorian England was largely based on your birth circumstances. In this
section, {{ the_author }} acknowledges one of his inspirations---{{ swifts }}
ironic essay {{ a_modest_proposal }}---by suggesting "that the Irregular
offspring be painlessly and mercifully consumed."

The geometry part of the book---where Square visits Lineland (1D), Spaceland
(3D), and Pointland (0D)---is thought-provoking in how it makes you think
about geometry. A fun observation is that each N-dimensional being finds (N-1)
dimensions trivial, their own N-dimensional world the obvious limit, and (N+1)
dimensions inconceivable. When Square works out through induction the
existence of 4th and 5th dimensional worlds, his 3D guide---Sphere---rejects
it immediately.

After reading, it seems so simple to imagine that I can picture a hypercube
just by thinking "Upward, not Northward." But alas, I'm stuck with my standard
method of visualizing N-dimensions: thinking of 3D and repeating to myself
"N-dimension, N-dimensions!" over and over again.[^apologies]

[^apologies]: I stole this from someone, but I couldn't find the source.

The book is short and the setting is fun. The social commentary is dated, but
the geometry part is as fresh and informative as ever.
