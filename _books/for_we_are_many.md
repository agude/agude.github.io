<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It focuses on the
Others storyline while also continuing many of the side stories begun in {% book_link "We Are Legion (We Are Bob)" %}.

{{ this_book }} picks up right where {{ bob1 }} left off. It adds a few new
stories while also continuing some of the old ones. Here are a few I liked:

- The advancement of the Deltans, the discovery of a new predator, and the
  banishment of _Bawbe_.

- The suicide of Homer and the destruction of VEHEMENT.

- Henry, the Australian probe who'd rather be sailing.

- Further battles with the now upgraded Brazilian probes.

- Colonizing the first non-Earth worlds.

- The reveal of the Others, and the first crushing defeat of the Bobs.

{{ this_book }} held my interest even though each storyline is simple and
straightforward. This surprised me, because being able to predict the shape of
a story after only reading a few pages is one of my top annoyances. Reading
predictable books feels like slogging through words, and it's one of the
things I didn't like about {{ algernon }}. But because the {{ bobiverse }}
moves so fast and has so many stories, I couldn't predict the path of the
narrative even though I could for each piece. In that way, it felt like a
(much less complicated) {{ pandora }}.

There is another way in which the {{ bobiverse }} and the {{ commonwealth_saga
}} are similar: both make heavy use of memory backups to cheat death. However,
each takes a different views of what it means. In the Commonwealth universe, a
backup is as good as the original you (even if multiple of them can run around
at the same time, as in {{ night }}). Bob, on the other hand, does not
consider a backup to be himself, but a new being that shares the same
memories. Bob's point of view makes sense because backups are how he makes new
probes, and those **are clearly** "different people".

I love the continued fast pace and the higher stakes the Others bring to {{
this_book }}. I can't wait to start {{ bob3 }}.
