<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> the second book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It centers The
Others storyline while also continuing many of the side stories begun in {%
include book_link.html title="We Are Legion (We Are Bob)" %}.

{{ this_book }} just continues {{ bob1 }}, continuing the existing storylines
and adding some more. Some of the ones I liked:

- The continued advancement of the Deltans, the discovery of a new predator,
  and the banishment of _Bawbe_.
- The death of Homer and the destruction of VEHEMENT.
- Henry the Australian probe.
- Further battles with the now upgrade Brazilian probes.
- Colonizing the first non-Earth worlds.
- The reveal of the Others, and the first crushing defeat of the Bobs.

{{ this_book }} held my interest even though though each storyline in {{
this_book }} is simple and straightforward. This surprised me, because being
able to predict the shape of a story after only reading a few pages is one of
my top annoyances. Reading predictable books feels like slogging through
words, and it is one of the things I didn't like about {{ algernon }}, for
example. But because the {{ bobiverse }} moves so fast and has so many
stories, I couldn't predict the path of the narrative even though I could for
each piece. In that way it felt like a (much less complicated) {{ pandora }}.

And speaking of which, both the {{ bobiverse }} and the {{ commonwealth_saga
}} make heavy use of memory backups to cheat death, but take different views
of what it means: in the Commonwealth universe a backup is as good as you
(even if multiple of them can run around at the same time, as in {{ night }}),
whereas Bob does not consider a backup to be the same being, but a new one
the shares the same thoughts. The point of view of the Bob makes sense because
they have to be "different people" since backing up is the same process they
use to make new clones, which **are** clearly "different people". Still,
neither book touches on the philosophical implications too much.

I love the continued fast pace and the higher stakes of {{ this_book }}. I
can't wait to start {{ bob3 }}.
