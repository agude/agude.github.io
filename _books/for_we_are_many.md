<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It centers the
Others storyline while also continuing many of the side stories begun in {%
include book_link.html title="We Are Legion (We Are Bob)" %}.

{{ this_book }} picks up right where {{ bob1 }} left off. It adds a few new
stories while also continuing some of the old ones. I a few I liked:

- The advancement of the Deltans, the discovery of a new predator, and the
  banishment of _Bawbe_.
- The suicide of Homer and the destruction of VEHEMENT.
- Henry the Australian probe, who'd rather be sailing.
- Further battles with the now upgrade Brazilian probes.
- Colonizing the first non-Earth worlds.
- The reveal of the Others, and the first crushing defeat of the Bobs.

{{ this_book }} held my interest even though though each storyline is simple
and straightforward. This surprised me, because being able to predict the
shape of a story after only reading a few pages is one of my top annoyances.
Reading predictable books feels like slogging through words, and it is one of
the things I didn't like about {{ algernon }}. But because the {{ bobiverse }}
moves so fast and has so many stories, I couldn't predict the path of the
narrative even though I could for each piece. In that way it felt like a (much
less complicated) {{ pandora }}.

And speaking of which, both the {{ bobiverse }} and the {{ commonwealth_saga
}} make heavy use of memory backups to cheat death, but take different views
of what it means: in the Commonwealth universe a backup is as good as you
(even if multiple of them can run around at the same time, as in {{ night }}),
whereas Bob does not consider a backup to be himself, but a new being the
shares the same memories. The point of view of Bob makes sense because backups
are how he makes new probes, and those **are clearly** "different people".

I love the continued fast pace and the higher stakes the Others bring to {{
this_book }}. I can't wait to start {{ bob3 }}.
