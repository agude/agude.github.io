<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> the second book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It centers The
Others storyline while also continuing many of the side stories begun in {%
include book_link.html title="We Are Legion (We Are Bob)" %}.

{{ this_book }} just continues {{ bob1 }}, continuing the existing storylines
and adding some more. Some of the ones I liked:

- The continued advancement of the Deltans, the discovery of a new predator,
  and the banishment of _Bawbe_.
- The death of Homer and the destruction of VEHEMENT.
- Henry the Australian probe.
- Further battles with the now upgrade Brazilian probes.
- Colonizing the first non-Earth worlds.
- The reveal of the Others, and the first crushing defeat of the Bobs.

One thing that annoys me when reading a book is if after 50 pages I can tell
you how the entire arc of the story is going to go. Reading these books feels
like slogging through words, and it is one of the things I didn't like about
{{ algernon }}, for example. The {{ series }} books _should_ have the same
problem---each storyline is only 15 pages and generally pretty cliche---but
because there are so many of them I don't really notice; the pace keeps it
from being a slog.

In {{ this_book }} the Bobs make backups of themselves, but they realize that
these backups aren't them, just an entity with the same memories. This is
different from the view taken in {{ pandora }} which never really grapples
with the idea of whether or not your backup is you; but neither book dives
deep on the idea. The point of view of the Bob makes sense because they have
to be "different people" since backing up is the same process they use to make new
clones, which **are** clearly "different "people".

I love the continued fast pace and the higher stakes of {{ this_book }}. I
can't wait to start {{ bob3 }}.
