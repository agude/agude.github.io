{{ this_book }} begins just moments after the ending of {{ dragons_egg }}.
Unlike its predecessor, {{ this_book }} presents a more straightforward
narrative, with characters who---thanks to the Cheela's natural
regeneration---remain present for longer than 15 human minutes.

The story's initial conflict arises when the human spacecraft is damaged, and
the Cheela pledge to repair it. This section is both amusing and
thought-provoking due to the stark contrast between the perspectives. The
humans see an urgent crisis mere minutes away from disaster, while the Cheela
view it as a long-term, somewhat boring project. We watch the Cheela
population gradually losing interest, their government postponing votes and
shelving critical bills, and the space fleet Cheela struggling to secure
funding to fulfill their promise. In a way, this becomes a study of how
societies handle large-scale, slow-moving crises---not unlike our own
challenges with issues such as [climate change][gw].

The book's central conflict unfolds shortly after the humans are rescued, when
a massive starquake decimates the Cheela civilization, leaving only four
survivors on the star and a few hundred in orbit. The remainder of the novel
follows the Cheela---and humans---as they rebuild their society, confront the
barbarian Cheela who rise to take control of the star, and work to restore
their technological capabilities, allowing them to rescue the humans again. In
a not-so-surprising turn of events, the humans play a crucial role in the
battle against the barbarians by using their LIDAR to blind the horde. This
was foreshadowed earlier with a reference to {{ lion }}, suggesting that even
the technologically inferior humans might one day again be able to help the
Cheela.

The large cast of characters who persist across hundreds of generations
reminds me of {{ hamiltons }} works, like the {{ commonwealth }}, {{ void }},
and {{ fallers }}; which is reinforced by the theme of building super-advanced
technology. While the plot's rising tension and climax provide the novel with
clear direction, it limits the amount of detail {{ the_author }} can include,
which was the highlight of {{ dragons_egg }}. Still, it's impressive that he
was able to echo the structure of the first book, once again depicting the
Cheela building their civilization from scratch. In the end, these factors
mostly balance out, resulting in a book about as good as the first.

{{ the_author }} was inspired by {{ clements }} {{ gravity }} when writing
this series, so that is the next book I plan to read.
