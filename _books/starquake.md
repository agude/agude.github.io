<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in the
Cheela series by <span class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>.
Unlike the first book, {% include book_link.html title="Dragon's Egg" %}, this
one features a more traditional plot centered around a devastating starquake.

{{ this_book }} begins just moments after the ending of {{ dragons_egg }}.
Unlike its predecessor, {{ this_book }} presents a more straightforward
narrative, with characters who---thanks to the Cheela's natural
regeneration---remain present for longer than 15 human minutes.

The story's initial conflict arises when the human spacecraft is damaged, and
the Cheela pledge to repair it. This section is both amusing and
thought-provoking due to the stark contrast between the perspectives. The
humans see an urgent crisis mere minutes away from disaster, while the Cheela
view it as a long-term, somewhat boring project. We watch the Cheela
population gradually losing interest, their government postponing votes and
shelving critical bills, and the space fleet Cheela struggling to secure
funding to fulfill their promise. In a way, this becomes a study of how
societies handle large-scale, slow-moving crises---not unlike our own
challenges with issues such as [climate change][gw].

The book's main conflict unfolds shortly after the humans are rescued when a
massive starquake decimates the Cheela civilization, leaving only four
survivors on the star and a few hundred in orbit. The remainder of the novel
follows the Cheela---and humans---as they rebuild society, confront the
barbarian Cheela who have taken control of the star, and work to restore their
technological capabilities, allowing them to once again rescue the humans by
the book's conclusion.

The large cast of characters who persist across hundreds of generations
reminds me of {{ hamlitons }} works, like the {{ commonwealth }}, {{ void }},
and {{ fallers }}. While the plot's rising tension and climax provide the
novel with clear direction, it limits the amount of detail {{ the_author }}
can include, which was the highlight of {{ dragons_egg }}. These factors
mostly balance out, resulting in a book about as good as the first.

{{ the_author }} was inspired by {{ clements }} {{ gravity }} when writing
this series, so that is the next book I plan to read.
