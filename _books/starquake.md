<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in the
Cheela series by <span class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>.
Unlike the first book, {% include book_link.html title="Dragon's Egg" %}, this
one has a traditional plot involving a dipterous Starquake.

{{ this_book }} takes place a few minutes after the ending of {{ dragons_egg
}}. Unlike its predecessor, {{ this_book }} has a straightforward plot, with
characters that---through the Cheela's natural regeneration---stay around for
longer than 15 human-minutes.

The first conflict begins when the human spacecraft is damaged and the Cheela
promise to fix it. It's fun and lighthearted because there is a juxtaposition
between how the humans view the situation---as an imminent emergency just
five minutes out---and how the Cheela who live a million times faster see
it---as something that have to get around to in the next ten years, if they
can keep their population interested that long. As such we see the Cheela
government kicking the can down the road, tabling votes until after elections,
while the space fleet Cheela try to drum up support.

The real conflict of the book kicks off shortly after the human rescue when a
massive starquake destroys the Cheela civilization, leaving only four
survivors on the star and only a few hundred in orbit. The rest of the book
follows the Cheelas---and humans---as they put the civilization back together,
fight off the barbarian Cheela that took over the star, and build their tech
level back up to be able to rescue the humans once again at the end of the
book.

The large ensemble cast with the same characters present over hundreds of
generations reminds me of {{ hamlitons }} works like the {{ commonwealth }}, {{
void }}, and {{ fallers }}. The plot, with rising tension and climax, helps
give the novel direction but also hampers it by reducing the amount of cool
stuff we {{ the_author }} can squeeze in. In the end these two mostly cancel
and you get a book about as good as {{ dragons_egg }}.

{{ the_author }} was inspired by {{ clements }} {{ gravity }} when writing
this series, so that is the next book I plan to read.
