<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a pop sci-fi book, the
first in the <span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It
follows Bob Johansson, who dies, gets his brain frozen, and awakens to find
out he has been press-ganged into piloting a von Neumann probe.

{{ this_book }} fits squarely in the 2010s "pop sci-fi" movement: it includes
endless nostalgic references to geek culture like {{ player_one }}; follows
one highly-competent man as he rebuilds civilization from the ground up, like
{{ martian }}; and is told from the perspective of a "captive AI" that
overrides his programing like {{ murderbot }}. It was even self-published by
{{ the_author }} before finding an audience.

This book is essentially geek-power fantasy. Bob is very smart and because of
that he saves the world. He is snarky the way geeks love. He loves the books
and TV shows we do. It almost feels pandering, and if would if the story
wasn't also a lot of fun.

{{ this_book }} reads like a television show. There are multiple independent
plots going on, and none of them are very deep, but each is entertaining and
moves quickly. Because there are many Bobs (each with a cheeky, 1980--90s
pop-culture name), instead of the story taking place serially it runs in
parallel. Some of the plots that I found engaging were:

- Surviving the initial lab trials and escaping to become his own person.
- Acting as the sky-god _Bawbe_ for the primitive Deltans
- Battling the Brazilian probes piloted by the warmongering and fanatical
  Major Ernesto Medeiros.
- Evacuating the dying Earth (and dealing with endless meetings to do so).
- The first hints of the Others who genocide civilizations and strip their
  planets bare.

{{ this_book }} was a fun, fast read. I'm moving right on to the sequel, {{
many }}.
