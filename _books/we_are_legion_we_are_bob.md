<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a pop sci-fi book, the
first in the <span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It
follows Bob Johansson, who dies, gets his brain frozen, and awakens to find
himself press-ganged into piloting a von Neumann probe.

{{ this_book }} fits squarely in the 2010s "pop sci-fi" movement: it includes
countless nostalgic references to geek culture like {{ player_one }}; follows
one highly-competent man as he rebuilds civilization from scratch like
{{ martian }}; and is told from the perspective of a "captive AI" that
overrides its programming like {{ murderbot }}. It was even self-published by
{{ the_author }} before finding an audience.

This book is essentially a geek-power fantasy. Bob is very smart, and because
of that, he saves the world. He's snarky in a way geeks love. He enjoys the
same books and TV shows we do. It would feel pandering if the story wasn't
also a lot of fun.

{{ this_book }} reads like a television show. There are multiple independent
plots going on, and while none of them are very deep, each is entertaining and
moves quickly. Because there are many Bobs (each with a cheeky, 1980s--90s
pop-culture name), the story unfolds in parallel rather than serially. Some of
the plots I found engaging were:

- Surviving the initial lab trials and escaping to become his own person.
- Acting as the sky-god _Bawbe_ for the primitive Deltans.
- Battling the Brazilian probes piloted by the warmongering and fanatical
  Major Ernesto Medeiros.
- Evacuating the dying Earth (and dealing with endless meetings to do so).
- The first hints of the Others who genocide civilizations and strip their
  planets bare.

{{ this_book }} was a fun, fast read. I'm moving right on to the sequel, {{
many }}.
