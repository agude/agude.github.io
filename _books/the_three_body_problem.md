<cite class="book-title">The Three-Body Problem</cite> was recommended as a
exciting, hard-scifi book full of new ideas. I was eager to read it, having
just gotten back into fiction. I bought it for my flight from Melbourne to San
Francisco and I threw it in the airport trash as I got off the plane.

Or that's what I wish I had done. Instead, I had 50 pages to go when I landed
and I finished it during the ride home, where I threw it in the trash (after
trying to give it away for a week).

The premise is promising: physics experiments have stopped working and several
prominent scientists have committed suicide. But that promise is not delivered
on. The characters are 1-dimensional and unlikable. The Cultural Revolution
part feels oddly romanticized. The video-game part is gimmicky. The writing is
bad.

I kept reading because I wanted unravel the mystery, but the explanation was
anticlimactic: aliens did it with a magic computer.

<cite class="book-title">The Three-Body Problem</cite> is the last book I'll
read by Liu Cixin.
