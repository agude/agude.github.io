{{ this_book }} is a shaggy dog story about Malachi Constant, who stumbles
through absurd adventures as he bounces from Earth to Mars to Venus, back to
Earth, and finally to Titan. It asks big questions about free will, the
purpose of life, and the role of religion. But I didn't particularly enjoy it.

After 319 pages, we learn that humanity---our entire history---was just a
giant, Rube Goldberg--style process designed to deliver a small replacement
part for a spaceship stranded on Titan. There's no deeper meaning to life,
only the meaning you make and the love you share with others. I agree with
that message! But I didn't like the framing story around it, and I didn't like
the characters. Reading it felt like slogging through just to reach the end.

The theme is the same one {{ banks }} explores again and again, first in {{
consider_phlebas }}, then {{ look_to_windward }}, and finally {{ hydrogen }}.
The difference is that I (mostly) enjoyed the characters and the pointless
stories they were caught up in. Here, I never did.

I think {{ the_authors_lastname_possessive }} writing is just too
straightforward for my tastes. I have a weakness for books that are a bit of a
puzzle. {{ echopraxia }}, where the narrator has no idea what's going on. {{
absalom_absalom }}, with its page-long sentences and a story that repeats and
reshapes itself each time you hear it. {{ sound_and_the_fury }}, with its
nonlinear timeline and mentally disabled narrator. And I had a lot of fun in
{{ hyperion }}, chasing down examples of the key themes and motifs. But {{
the_authors_lastname }} lays out the whole story and his thesis from the
start, and then you have to read through it anyway.

{{ this_book }} clearly influenced {{ adamss }} {{ hitchhikers_guide
}}. Marvin the depressed android is very similar to the depressed robot Salo.
Both books follow a character bumbling unwillingly through absurd adventures
that turns out to be pointless. {{ this_book }} has all of humanity created to
help deliver a pointless message while {{ hitchhikers_guide_short }} has the
pointless computation of the meaning of life. The difference is I found {{
hitchhikers_guide_short }} to be **hilarious**, and I didn't laugh once at {{
this_book }}.

There are a few other works it reminded me of as well. The high-class breeding
program reminded me of the Bene Gesserate in {{ dune }}. The rich people
without style reminded me of {{ great_gatsby }}. The weird, mid-century
religion and sci-fi reminded me of {{ stranger_in_a_strange_land }}. The
writing style was a bit like {{ stand_on_zanzibar }}, and so was the
unintentional absurdity of how small the world economy was. Constant writes
letters to himself to remember what is happening when his mind is wiped is
like {{ memento }}. Romfoord's plan to unite Earth by invading it from Mars is
similar to Ozymandius's plan in {{ watchmen }}. And {{ the_authors_lastname }}
used the idea of physical handicaps again in {{ harrison_bergeron }}.

One thing I did love are the little bits of wisdom scatter through the book:

> I was a victim of a series of accidents, as are we all

> The big trouble with dumb bastards is that they are too dumb to believe
> there is such a thing as being smart"

> There is no reason why good cannot triumph as often as evil. The triumph of
> anything is a matter of organization. If there are such things as angels, I
> hope that they are organized along the lines of the Mafia.

{{ the_authors_lastname_possessive }} writing is fantastic; I can see why
people love him, but this book wasn't for me. He is a key part of the American
canon, so I won't give up after just this. I'll probably work my way through
{{ cats_cradle }}, {{ slaughterhouse_five }}, and {{ breakfast_of_champions
}}. I hope I like them more.
