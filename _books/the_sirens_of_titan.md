<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>, is a satirical science
fiction novel about the richest man in America, Malachi Constant. It follows
his unwilling and absurd journey from Earth to Mars, Mercury, and finally
Titan, exploring questions about free will, the purpose of human history, and
the nature of religion along the way.

Ultimately, {{ this_book }} is a shaggy dog story. After 319 pages, we learn
that humanity---our entire history---was just a giant, Rube Goldberg-style
process designed to deliver a small replacement part for a spaceship stranded
on Titan. There's no deeper meaning to life, only the meaning you make and the
love you share with others. I agree with that message! But I didn't like the
framing story around it, and I didn't like the characters. Reading it felt
like slogging through just to reach the end.

The theme is the same one {{ banks }} explores again and again, first in {{
consider_phlebas }}, then {{ look_to_windward }}, and finally {{ hydrogen }}.
The difference is that I (mostly) enjoyed the characters and the pointless
stories they were caught up in. Here, I never did.

{{ this_book }} clearly influenced {{ adamss }} {{ hitchhikers_guide
}}.[^interview] Both books follow a character bumbling unwillingly through
absurd, ultimately pointless adventures. Marvin the depressed android is very
similar to the depressed robot Salo. In {{ this_book }}, all of humanity
exists just to help deliver a simple message, while in {{
hitchhikers_guide_short }} it's the computation of the meaningless meaning of
life. The difference is I found {{ hitchhikers_guide_short }} to be
**hilarious**, and I didn't laugh once at {{ this_book }}.

[^interview]: {{ adams }} said as much in an interview:

    > {{ the_author }}, who I think is absolutely superb. I've read
    > {{ this_book }} six times now, and it gets better every time. He is an
    > influence, I must own up. {{ this_book }} is just one of those
    > books---you read it through the first time and you think it's very
    > loosely, casually written. You think the fact that everything suddenly
    > makes such good sense at the end is almost accidental. And then you read
    > it a few more times, simultaneously finding out more about writing
    > yourself, and you realize what an absolute tour de force it was, making
    > something as beautifully honed as that appear so casual.

I think {{ the_authors_lastname_possessive }} writing is just too
straightforward for my tastes. I have a weakness for books that are a bit of a
puzzle. I love {{ echopraxia }}, where the narrator has no idea what's going
on; {{ absalom_absalom }}, with its page-long sentences and a story that
reshapes itself each time you hear it; {{ sound_and_the_fury }}, with its
nonlinear timeline and Benji's fractured narration; and {{ disco_elysium }},
where you have to piece together your identity and the world around you from
fragments of memory and unreliable thoughts. And I had a lot of fun recently
with {{ hyperion }}, chasing down examples of recurring themes and motifs. By
contrast, {{ the_authors_lastname }} lays out the whole story and his thesis
from the start---and then you still have to read through it. This was similar
to the issue I had with {{ algernon }}, where the clever narrative device
couldn't save a plot I found too predictable.

There were other works it reminded me of as well. The high-class breeding
program echoed the Bene Gesserit in {{ dune }}. The tasteless nouveau riche
reminded me of {{ great_gatsby }}. The blend of mid-century religion and
sci-fi is similar to {{ stranger_in_a_strange_land }}. The writing style was a
bit like {{ stand_on_zanzibar }}, and so was the unintentional absurdity where
any time an economic number was mentioned it was orders of magnitude too
small. Constant's writing letters to himself to remember things after his
memory is wiped felt like {{ memento }}. Rumfoord's plan to unite Earth by
invading it from Mars reminded me of Ozymandias's plan in {{ watchmen }}. And
{{ the_authors_lastname }} reused the idea of physical handicaps to achieve
equality in {{ harrison_bergeron }}.

For all that I didn't like about {{ this_book }}, {{
the_authors_lastname_possessive }} prose is wonderful: short and simple like
{{ hemingways }}. And like {{ hemingway_lastname }}, it's full of quiet
wisdom:

> I was a victim of a series of accidents, as are we all.

> The big trouble with dumb bastards is that they are too dumb to believe
> there is such a thing as being smart.

> There is no reason why good cannot triumph as often as evil. The triumph of
> anything is a matter of organization. If there are such things as angels, I
> hope that they are organized along the lines of the Mafia.

I can see why people love {{ the_authors_lastname }}, but this book wasn't for
me. He's a key part of the American canon, though, so I won't give up just
yet. I'll probably work my way through {{ cats_cradle }}, {{
slaughterhouse_five }}, and {{ breakfast_of_champions }} next. I hope I like
them more.
