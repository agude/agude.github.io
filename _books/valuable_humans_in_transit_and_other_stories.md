### {% short_story_title "Lena" %}
{% rating_stars 5 %}

{{ lena_link }} is my favorite short story from the past decade. It tells the
story of _MMAcevedo_, the first executable human brain image, written as a
Wikipedia article. The format is perfect: the dry, encyclopedic,
just-the-facts style contrasts sharply with the horrifying world being
described, where sentient human minds are run on banks of computers to perform
menial tasks.

The title, {{ lena_title }}, references model [Lena Forsén][lena_wiki] whose
[picture is commonly used as a test image][lenna_wiki] without her permission,
mirroring how _MMAcevedo_ is used without Miguel Álvarez Acevedo's consent.

Reading {{ lena_title }} again while reading the {{ bobiverse }} series is
interesting, as this short story shows the potential horrors of brain
emulation, while {{ bob1 }} presents it in a positive light.

### {% short_story_title "If You Are Reading This" %}
{% rating_stars 3 %}

{{ if_you_are_reading_this_link }} is about a speed runner who meets his
scientific idol, only to hear about the scientist's encounter with an alien
signal from a dying race. This story feels targeted directly at me---even
mentioning Dark Energy and Higgs research as cutting-edge scientific
work---but it falls flat. The ideas didn't feel exciting or novel.

### {% short_story_title "The Frame-by-Frame" %}
{% rating_stars 4 %}

This story follows a self-driving car discovering a man on the road ahead,
told as a conversation between the vehicle's different systems. The machine
must decide whether to clip the person or stop immediately. It accelerates
when it realizes the man is the car's former lead programmer who left for a
competing company.

### {% short_story_title "The Difference" %}
{% rating_stars 4 %}

{{ the_difference_link }} is an IRC chat between a person (or bot) and other
users. The main character claims to be an imprisoned human forced to chat with
people who think he is a bot. As the story progresses, we realize it's
impossible to determine the truth.

### {% short_story_title "George" %}
{% rating_stars 4 %}

{{ george_link }} follows a human spaceship that discovers a planet covered in
[grey goo][grey_wiki]. The crew theorizes that the civilization used it to
commit suicide, but they unwittingly unleash the goo upon the universe by
giving it access to space travel.

### {% short_story_title "cripes does anybody remember Google People" %}
{% rating_stars 3 %}

{{ cripes_link }} was originally composed on Twitter, taking the form of a
series of tweets. The author and others reminisce about a fictional social
network, Google People, and its strange AI or paranormal behavior.

### {% short_story_title "Driver" %}
{% rating_stars 4 %}

A follow-up to {{ lena_anchor }}, {{ driver_title }} is another Wikipedia
article, this time about a brain scan used as a slave driver for other brain
images. It expands on the world introduced in {{ lena_title }} and hints at a
mysterious _ele_.

### {% short_story_title "I Don't Know, Timmy, Being God Is a Big Responsibility" %}
{% rating_stars 5 %}

I had read a draft of {{ i_dont_know_timmy_link }} before but didn't remember
it was by {{ the_author }}, so this story gave me a sense of déjà vu. It's
about researchers who build an infinitely powerful computer and use it to
perfectly simulate Earth, only to realize they must also be living in a
simulation. The concept is engaging, and the story does a great job of
gradually revealing this twist.

### {% short_story_title "A Powerful Culture" %}
{% rating_stars 4 %}

This story offers a take on the infamous [_"We considered ourselves to be a
powerful culture. This place is not a place of honor..."_][honor] warning
message about nuclear waste storage. It imagines a scenario where Earth-1 has
deadly waste to dispose of, how they might dump it on other multiverse Earths,
and how those Earths would respond. It reminds me of {{ cleaning_up }} from {{
bankss }} {{ art }}.

### {% short_story_title "Valuable Humans in Transit" %}
{% rating_stars 5 %}

{{ valuable_humans_link }} is about an AI that controls all nanotechnology on
Earth. When an extinction-level asteroid hits, it decides to forcibly digitize
all humans and transmit them off-world. I particularly enjoyed the ending,
where the AI must emulate some of the physicists it digitized to invent
faster-than-light travel in order to build a receiver for the signal. In a
way, it is a mirror of {{ if_you_are_reading_this_anchor }}.
