### Lena
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">Lena</cite>][lena_story] is my favorite short
story from the past decade. It tells the story of _MMAcevedo_, the first
executable human brain image, written as a Wikipedia article. The format is
perfect: the dry, encyclopedic, just-the-facts style contrasts sharply with
the horrifying world being described, where sentient human minds are run on
banks of computers to perform menial tasks.

The title, <cite class="short-story-title">Lena</cite>, references model [Lena
Forsén][lena_wiki] whose [picture is commonly used as a test
image][lenna_wiki] without her permission, mirroring how _MMAcevedo_ is used
without Miguel Álvarez Acevedo's consent.

Reading <cite class="short-story-title">Lena</cite> again while reading the {{
bobiverse }} series is interesting, as this short story shows the potential
horrors of brain emulation, while {{ bob1 }} presents it in a positive light.

### If You Are Reading This
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">If You Are Reading
This</cite>][reading_story] is about a speed runner who meets his scientific
idol, only to hear about the scientist's encounter with an alien signal from a
dying race. This story feels targeted directly at me---even mentioning Dark
Energy and Higgs research as cutting-edge scientific work---but it falls flat.
The ideas didn't feel exciting or novel.

### The Frame-by-Frame
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

This story follows a self-driving car discovering a man on the road ahead,
told as a conversation between the vehicle's different systems. The machine
must decide whether to clip the person or stop immediately. It accelerates
when it realizes the man is the car's former lead programmer who left for a
competing company.

### The Difference
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">The Difference</cite>][diff_story] is an IRC
chat between a person (or bot) and other users. The main character claims to
be an imprisoned human forced to chat with people who think he is a bot. As
the story progresses, we realize it's impossible to determine the truth.

### George
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">George</cite>][george_story] follows a human
spaceship that discovers a planet covered in [grey goo][grey_wiki]. The crew
theorizes that the civilization used it to commit suicide, but they
unwittingly unleash the goo upon the universe by giving it access to space
travel.

### cripes does anybody remember Google People
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">cripes does anybody remember Google
People</cite>][google_story] was originally composed on Twitter, taking the
form of a series of tweets. The author and others reminisce about a fictional
social network, Google People, and its strange AI or paranormal behavior.

### Driver
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

A follow-up to [<cite class="short-story-title">Lena</cite>][lena_interlink],
<cite class="short-story-title">Driver</cite> is another Wikipedia article,
this time about a brain scan used as a slave driver for other brain images. It
expands on the world introduced in <cite class="short-story-title">Lena</cite>
and hints at a mysterious _ele_.

### I Don't Know, Timmy, Being God Is a Big Responsibility
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

I had read a draft of [<cite class="short-story-title">I Don't Know, Timmy,
Being God Is a Big Responsibility</cite>][tim_story] before but didn't
remember it was by {{ the_author }}, so this story gave me a sense of déjà vu.
It's about researchers who build an infinitely powerful computer and use it to
perfectly simulate Earth, only to realize they must also be living in a
simulation. The concept is engaging, and the story does a great job of
gradually revealing this twist.

### A Powerful Culture
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

This story offers a take on the infamous [_"We considered ourselves to be a
powerful culture. This place is not a place of honor…"_][honor] warning
message about nuclear waste storage. It imagines a scenario where Earth-1 has
deadly waste to dispose of, how they might dump it on other multiverse Earths,
and how those Earths would respond. It reminds me of {{ cleaning_up }} from {{
bankss }} {{ art }}.

### Valuable Humans in Transit
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">Valuable Humans in
Transit</cite>][valueable_story] is about an AI that controls all
nanotechnology on Earth. When an extinction-level asteroid hits, it decides to
forcibly digitize all humans and transmit them off-world. I particularly
enjoyed the ending, where the AI must emulate some of the physicists it
digitized to invent faster-than-light travel in order to build a receiver for
the signal. In a way, it is a mirror of [<cite class="short-story-title">If
You Are Reading This</cite>][if_you_are_interlink].
