### Lena
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">Lena</cite>][lena_story] is my favorite short
story that I've read in the last decade. It tells the story of _MMAcevedo_,
the first executable human brain image, written as a Wikipedia article. The
format is perfect: the dry, encyclopedic, just-the-facts style contrasts with
the horrifying world being described, a world where feeling, sentient human
minds are run on banks of computers to perform menial task.

The title, <cite class="short-story-title">Lena</cite>, references model [Lena
Forsén][lena_wiki] whose [picture is used as common a test image][lenna_wiki]
without her permission, just as _MMAcevedo_ is used without Miguel Álvarez
Acevedo's permission.

Reading <cite class="short-story-title">Lena</cite> again while reading the {{
bobiverse }} series is interesting, because this short story shows the
potential horrors of brain emulation, while {{ bob1 }} shows it in a positive
light.

### If You Are Reading This
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">If You Are Reading
This</cite>][reading_story] is the story of a speed runner who meets his
scientific idol, only to hear about how the scientist once received an alien
signal from a dying race. This story feels targeted directly at me---even
calling out work on Dark Energy and the Higgs as the most cutting edge
scientific research---but the story fell kind of flat. The ideas didn't feel
existing or new.

### The Frame-by-Frame
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

The story of a self-driving car discovering a man on the roadway ahead, told
as a conversation between the different systems. The machine must decide if it
is OK to clip the person or if it has to stop immediately. It accelerates into
them when it realizes the man is the car's former lead-programmer who left for
another company.

### The Difference
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">The Difference</cite>][diff_story] is an IRC
chat between a person/bot and some other people or bots. The main character
claims to be an imprisoned human who is forced to chat with people who think
he is a bot, and we soon realize it is impossible to tell if he actually is.

### George
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">George</cite>][george_story] is the story of
a human spaceship finds a planet covered in [grey goo][grey_wiki]. They
hypothesize that the civilization used it to commit suicide, and unwittingly
unleash the goo on the universe by giving it space travel.

### cripes does anybody remember Google People
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">cripes does anybody remember Google
People</cite>][google_story] was originally composed on Twitter, and so takes
the form of a series of Tweets. In the Tweets, the author and others reminise
about a fictional social network, Google People, and its weird AI or
paranormal behavior.

### Driver
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

A follow up to [<cite class="short-story-title">Lena</cite>][lena_interlink],
<cite class="short-story-title">Driver</cite> is a Wikipedia article about
another brain scan, this one used as a slave driver for other brain images. It
expands on the world, and hints at a mysterious _ele_.

### I Don't Know, Timmy, Being God Is a Big Responsibility
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

I read a draft of [<cite class="short-story-title">I Don't Know, Timmy, Being
God Is a Big Responsibility</cite>][tim_story] before and didn't remember that
it was by {{ the_author }}, so this story gave me a sense of déjà vu. It is
about researchers who build an infinitely powerful computer and use it to
perfectly simulate Earth, at which point they realize they must also live in a
simulation. The idea is fun and story does a good job of easing into the
revelation.

### A Powerful Culture
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

A take on the infamous [_"We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.
This place is not a place of honor…"_][honor] warning message about nuclear
waste storage, this story imagines if Earth-1 had deadly waste it had to get
rid of, how they might dump it on other multi-verse Earths, and how those
Earths would respond. It reminds me of {{ cleaning_up }} from {{ bankss }} {{
art }}.

### Valuable Humans in Transit
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

[<cite class="short-story-title">Valuable Humans in
Transit</cite>][valueable_story] is about the AI the runs all the
nanotechnology on Earth, and how when an extinction-level asteroid hits it
decides to forcibly-digitize all the humans and transmit them off world. I
thought the ending was great, where the AI now has to emulate some physicists
that it digitized in order to invent faster than light travel so it can build
a receiver for the signal.
