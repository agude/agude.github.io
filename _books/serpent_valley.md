<span class="book-title">Serpent Valley</span> is the third book in the War
Horses series. Like the previous two, it's a quick read with a lot of action,
but without any of the defects that held the other two back! It is my favorite
book of the series by far!

The story is split into two parts:

- The first part follows Vandal as he and the maintenance techs travel on a
  civilian freighter with a selection of ancient mechs that they need to get
  into fighting condition before they land. They soon realize their is an
  enemy saboteur onboard.
- The second part takes place after they land, and is full of action. Vandal
  leads a rag-tag group of rebels into battle against the planetary government.

The plotting is tight and the pacing is perfect, and unlike {% include
book_link.html title="Ymir" %} the transition between the different parts of
the plot flows perfectly. The first part of the book is a little
slower, with time for character development, and a mystery as they
protagonists try to find the spy. They second part is all action.

Warren is clearly figuring out the characters, the world, and the writing
style. I can't wait for the next book: {% include book_link.html title="Dog
Solider" %}.
