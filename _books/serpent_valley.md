<span class="book-title">Serpent Valley</span> is the third book in the War
Horses series. Like the previous two, it's a quick read with a lot of action,
but without any of the defects that held the other two back! It is my favorite
book of the series by far!

The story follows Vandal as he is sent on a mysterious job to support some
rebels. The first half of the book takes place on a ship in transit as Vandal
and his crew refurbish some ancient mechs, and the second half takes place
after they land and fight for the rebellion.

The plotting is tight and the pacing is perfect. The first part of the book
involves realizing there is a saboteur on the ship and figuring out who they
are, while the second part is more standard mech-on-mech combat.
