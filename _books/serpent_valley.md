<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, the third book in the <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series, is another quick,
action-packed read---but without the flaws holding back its predecessors.
Easily my favorite of the series so far!

The story of {{ this_book }} is split into two parts:

- The first, where Vandal and the techs travel on a freighter carrying antique
  mechs that they must get ready for battle before they land. They soon
  realize there's a saboteur aboard and they try uncovering the spy. The
  pacing is slower, with lots of time for character development.

- The second, after landing, is nonstop action. Vandal leads a ragtag rebel
  team battling the planetary government using the mechs he and his team fixed
  up in the first part.

Throughout the book, Vandal repairs and pilots one mech, gaining intimate
knowledge of its strengths and weaknesses. In a clever twist, he must leverage
this understanding not to push the machine to its limits against the
rebellion's enemies, but to destroy it when a traitor steals the mech and
deserts.

The plotting is tight, the pacing perfect. Unlike {{ ymir }}, transitions
between plot lines flow seamlessly. The balanced mix of mystery, intrigue, and
action show that {{ the_author }} has really figured out his characters,
worldbuilding, and style. I can't wait for the next book: {{ dog_soldier }}.
