<span class="book-title">Serpent Valley</span>, the third book in the War
Horses series, is another quick, action-packed read---but without the flaws
holding back its predecessors. Easily my favorite of the series so far!

The story is split into two parts:

- The first, Vandal and the techs travel on a freighter carrying antique mechs
  that they must get ready for battle before they land. They soon realize
  there's a saboteur aboard and they try uncovering the spy. The pacing is
  slower, with lots of time for character development.

- The second, after landing, is nonstop action. Vandal leads a ragtag rebel
  team battling the planetary government.

Throughout the book, Vandal repairs and pilots one mech, gaining intimate
knowledge of its strengths and weaknesses. In a clever twist, he must leverage
this understanding not to push the machine to its limits against the
rebellion's enemies, but to destroy it when a traitor steals the mech and
deserts.

The plotting is tight, the pacing perfect. Unlike {% include book_link.html
title="Ymir" %}, transitions between plot lines flow seamlessly. The balanced
mix of mystery, intrigue, and action show that the author has really figured
out his characters, worldbuilding, and style. I can't wait for the next book:
