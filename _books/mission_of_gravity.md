<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a sci-fi adventure story
set on the planet Mesklin---a massive, rapidly rotating world with gravity
much higher than Earth's. It follows Barlennan, a Mesklinite, as he sails the
_Bree_ across the planet in search of a lost human rocket ship.

{{ this_book }} is primarily story-driven. Barlennan, a centipede-like alien,
and his crew journey to unknown parts of Mesklin on their ship, the _Bree_,
encountering strange inhabitants as they seek to rescue the humans' rocket
stranded at the pole. The main attraction of the book lies in observing the
Mesklinites meet new tribes and survive their encounters through a combination
of human knowledge and Mesklinite cunning. Some memorable encounters include:

- Gigantic builders who construct cities as traps to snare even larger
  predators.

- Primitive canoe-building Mesklinites who capture the crew but release them
  after being tricked into believing the radio is a god.

- Island-dwelling Mesklinites who have developed gliders in the lower-gravity
  equatorial region and attempt to impound the _Bree_ and its crew as
  suspected spies.

The adventures are fun, but don't really come together into a greater whole.
{{ this_book }} never really builds any tension because you know Barlennan is
going to succeed, so each conflict feels more like a delay from the real
story. There is a hint that Barlennan has a secret motive for helping the
humans, but at the end it is exactly what it seemed: he wants to bootstrap
Mesklinite technology by investigating the human rocket, but through his
journey realizes that:

While these adventures are fun, they don't come together into a great whole.
{{ this_book }} lacks tension because Barlennan's ultimate success seems
inevitable, making each conflict feel more like a delay than a significant
plot development. There's a hint that Barlennan has a secret motive for
helping the humans, but it turns out to be exactly what it appeared: he wants
to advance Mesklinite technology by studying the human rocket. However,
through his journey, he realizes that:

1. He won't be able to understand the technology.

2. The humans would willingly share anyway.

So even this subplot doesn't build tension.

{{ this_book }} is said to have inspired {{ forwards }} {{ cheela }} series:
{{ dragon }} and {{ starquake }}. While both explore life under immense
gravity, {{ forward }} takes the concept further than {{ the_author }}. He
introduces much stronger gravity, essentially creating a 2D civilization;
incorporates strong magnetic fields that significantly impact the Cheela's
evolution and experience; and covers a broader narrative, from the discovery
of agriculture to space travel. The Cheela's accelerated time experience---one
million times faster than humans---is the key that allows the story to surpass
{{ this_book }}.

One part of the fun of reading old sci-fi is seeing what technology an author
mispredicts; I pointed out a few cases before, for example in my review of {{
eater }}. But {{ this_book }} does a particularly bad job. The central
conflict only exists because wireless data transmission is nearly impossible
in the story's setting. Characters can travel the stars but use slide rules
for calculation---the electric calculator was invented just 8 years after the
book was published! They can't create digital maps, instead manually pasting
together hard-copy photographs from orbit. The novel's world is analog while
our actual future is digital.

I think the wrong technology really stands out in {{ this_book }} because it
is so narrowly focused on the day-to-day life of Barlennan and his crew. {{
childhood }}, written around the same time, also makes several wrong
predictions, but its broader focus on humanity's fate makes these easier to
overlook.

{{ this_book }} was good but not great. Perhaps I would have found it more
groundbreaking had I read it before the {{ cheela }} series, but in
comparison, it felt underwhelming. I plan to read {{ star_light }}, the next
book in the series, but I don't expect much of it.
