<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a sci-fi adventure story
that takes place on the planet Mesklin---a gigantic, quickly rotating planet
with gravity much higher than Earth. It follows the Mesklinite named Barlennan
as he sails the _Bree_ across the planet searching for a lost human rocket
ship.

{{ this_book }} is story-driven. Barlennan---a centipede like alien---and his crew
travel to unknown parts of Mesklin on their ship the _Bree_ and discover
strange inhabitants on their way to rescue the humans' rocket stuck at the
pole. This is the main attraction of the book, watching the Mesklinites meet
new tribes and surviving their encounters through humanity knowledge and
Mesklinite cunning. Some of the memorable ones are:

- The gigantic builders, who make their cities as a trap to snare the local,
  even-larger predators.

- The primitive canoe-building Mesklinite, who capture the crew but release
  them them after being fooled into thinking the radio is a god.

- The island-dwelling Mesklinites who developed gliders in the lower gravity
  region near the equator and want to impound the _Bree_ and its sailors as
  spies.

The adventures are fun, but don't really come together into a greater whole.
{{ this_book }} never really builds any tension because you know Barlennan is
going to succeed, so each conflict feels more like a delay from the real
story. There is a hint that Barlennan has a secret motive for helping the
humans, but at the end it is exactly what it seemed: he wants to bootstrap
Mesklinite technology by investigating the human rocket, but through his
journey realizes that:

1. He won't be able to understand it.

2. The humans would share anyway.

So even that doesn't really build tension.

{{ this_book }} is said to have inspired {{ forwards }} {{ cheela }} series: {{
dragon }} and {{ starquake }}.

But {{ forward }} takes it a leap beyond {{ the_author }}: he adds much
stronger gravity which makes his civilization essentially 2D; he adds strong
magnetic fields that significantly impact how the Cheela evolve and experience
the world; and he covers a much larger story, from the discovery of farming to
space travel. The fact that the Cheela experience time one million times
faster than humans is a key twist that allows the story to surpass {{
this_book }}.

One part of the fun of reading old sci-fi is seeing what technology an author
mispredicts; I pointed out a few cases before, for example in my review of {{
eater }}. But {{ this_book }} does a particularly bad job. The central
conflict is only exists because wireless data transmission is nearly
impossible in the story's setting. The characters can travel the stars but use
slide rules for calculation---the electric calculator was invented only 8
years after the book was published! They can't create digital maps, instead
relying on manually pasting together hard-copy photographs from orbit. In
essence, the novel's world is stubbornly analog while our actual future is
digital.
