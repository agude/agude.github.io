Seeing what technology an author mispredicts is part of the fun of reading old
sci-fi; I pointed out a few cases before, for example in my review of {{
eater }}. But {{ this_book }} does a particularly bad job. The central
conflict is only a conflict because wireless data transmission is nearly
impossible. The characters can travel the stars but use slide rules---the
electric calculator was invented only 8 years after the book was published!
They can't create a map on a computer, they have to do it by pasting together
photographs taken from orbit. In general, the world is strictly analog while
the real future is digital.
