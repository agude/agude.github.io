<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a sci-fi adventure story
that takes place on the planet Mesklin---a gigantic, quickly rotating planet
with gravity much higher than Earth. It follows the Mesklinite named Barlennan
as he sails the _Bree_ across the planet searching for a lost human rocket
ship.

The story is basically an adventure. Barlennan and his crew travel to unknown
parts of Mesklin and encounter strange inhabitants.

The island-dweling glider builders.

Seeing what technology an author mispredicts is part of the fun of reading old
sci-fi; I pointed out a few cases before, for example in my review of {{
eater }}. But {{ this_book }} does a particularly bad job. The central
conflict is only exists because wireless data transmission is nearly
impossible in the story's setting. The characters can travel the stars but use
slide rules for calculation---the electric calculator was invented only 8
years after the book was published! They can't create digital maps, instead
relying on manually pasting together hard-copy photographs from orbit.
In essence, the novel's world is stubbornly analog while our actual future is
digital.
