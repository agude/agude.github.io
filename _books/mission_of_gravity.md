<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a sci-fi adventure story
set on the planet Mesklin---a massive, rapidly rotating world with gravity
much higher than Earth's. It follows Barlennan, a Mesklinite, as he sails the
_Bree_ across the planet in search of a lost human rocket ship.

{{ this_book }} is primarily story-driven. Barlennan, a centipede-like alien,
and his crew journey to unknown parts of Mesklin on their ship, the _Bree_,
coming across strange inhabitants as they seek to rescue the humans' rocket
stranded at the pole. The main appeal of the book lies in observing how the
Mesklinites interact with new tribes and navigate these situations through a
combination of human knowledge and Mesklinite cunning. Some memorable
encounters include:

- Gigantic builders who construct cities as traps to snare even larger
  predators.

- Primitive canoe-building Mesklinites who capture the crew but release them
  after being tricked into believing the radio is a god.

- Island-dwelling Mesklinites who have developed gliders in the lower-gravity
  equatorial region and attempt to impound the _Bree_ and its crew as
  suspected spies.

The adventures are fun, but don't really come together into a greater whole.
{{ this_book }} never really builds any tension because you know Barlennan is
going to succeed, so each conflict feels more like a delay than a significant
plot development. There is a hint that Barlennan has a secret motive for
helping the humans, but at the end it is exactly what it appeared to be: he
wants to advance Mesklinite technology by studying the human rocket. But the
impact of this reveal is blunted because, through his journey, Barlennan
realizes that:

1. He won't be able to understand the technology.

2. The humans would willingly share anyway.

{{ this_book }} is said to have inspired {{ forwards }} {{ cheela }} series:
{{ dragon }} and {{ starquake }}. While both explore life under immense
gravity, {{ forward }} takes the concept further.

He introduces much stronger gravity, essentially creating a 2D civilization;
incorporates strong magnetic fields that significantly impact the Cheela's
evolution and experience; and covers a broader narrative, from the discovery
of agriculture to space travel, due to the fact that the Cheela experience the
universe one million times faster than humans. While {{ this_book }} felt like
Earth with a twist, the {{ cheela }} series transported me to a completely
alien world.

Part of the fun of reading old sci-fi is seeing what technology an author
mispredicts; I pointed out a few cases before, for example in my review of {{
eater }}. But {{ this_book }} does a particularly bad job. The central
conflict only exists because wireless data transmission is nearly impossible
in the story's setting. Characters can travel the stars but use slide rules
for calculation---the electric calculator was invented just 8 years after the
book was published! They can't create digital maps, instead manually pasting
together hard-copy photographs from orbit. The novel's world is analog while
our actual future is digital.

I think the wrong technology really stands out in {{ this_book }} because it
is so narrowly focused on the day-to-day life of Barlennan and his crew. {{
childhood }}, written around the same time, also makes several wrong
predictions, but its broader focus on humanity's fate makes these easier to
overlook.

{{ this_book }} was good but not great. Perhaps I would have found it more
groundbreaking had I read it before the {{ dragon }} and {{ starquake }}, but
in comparison, it felt underwhelming. I plan to read {{ star_light }}, the
next book in the series, but I don't expect much of it.
