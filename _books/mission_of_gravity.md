Seeing what technology an author mispredicts is part of the fun of reading old
sci-fi; I pointed out a few cases before, for example in my review of {{
eater }}. But {{ this_book }} does a particularly bad job. The central
conflict is only exists because wireless data transmission is nearly
impossible in the story's setting. The characters can travel the stars but use
slide rules for calculation---the electric calculator was invented only 8
years after the book was published! They can't create digital maps, instead
relying on manually pasting together hard-copy photographs from orbit.
In essence, the novel's world is stubbornly analog while our actual future is
digital.
