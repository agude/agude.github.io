<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>, is the sixth <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> book, but it is very different
from typical Culture novels: there are no spaceships and almost no advanced
technology. Instead, it follows Culture citizens DeWar and Vosill as they
manipulate a medieval society.

{{ this_book }} is polarizing: on [goodreads][gr] it has a reader score of
3.95---lower than any other Culture novel except {{ c1 }}. I understand why:
the {{ this_series }} is generally "space opera", and {{ this_book }} doesn't
have a single spaceship, ray gun, or Mind. It reads like standard fantasy with
only hints of technology. And I loved it.

The title, {{ this_book }}, refers to several different things:

- The book is an _inversion_ of the standard Culture narrative. In {{ c2 }}
  and {{ c3 }}, we saw the Culture manipulate less advanced civilizations from
  the Culture's perspective. In {{ this_book }}, we see it from the
  perspective of the manipulated civilization.

- DeWar and Vosill's ideas of how best to do good _invert_ in the story. In
  DeWar's stories of their past, he thought sometimes evil was necessary for
  the greater good while Vosill believed it wasn't. In the present, DeWar is a
  bodyguard who kills only in defense, while Vosill steers the course of the
  world through manipulation and assassination.

- There are many role _inversions_ as well:  DeWar is an assassin who
  protects, Vosill is a doctor who kills. The UrLeyn is an oppressive
  anti-monarchist, Quience is a democratizing monarch.

{{ this_book }} is similar to {{ torture }}. Both are sci-fi novels that take
place in a "fantasy world", with hints of but no explicit advanced technology.
A torturer's apprentice is even one of the first characters to appear in {{
this_book }} when he summons Vosill and Oelph to his master.

I really enjoyed the two parallel stories, which only become clearly
intertwined at the very end. The characters were compelling, especially how
Vosill's true nature is revealed when it's insinuated that she was behind all
the murders and poisoned the king to insure her own escape. UrLeyn's gradual
descent was also subtly portrayed, explaining why DeWar didn't see it coming.

My one critique is how sexual violence is used against the two primary female
characters. Perrund's backstory revolves around being raped by UrLeyn after he
murdered her family, while Vosill faces an attempted rape before her knife
missile intervenes. This reliance on sexual assault to threaten the characters
feels exploitative.

I appreciate how {{ the_author }} changes his style in each book in {{ series
}}: from the point of view of the Culture's enemies in {{ c1 }}; through the
lens of a reluctant game player in {{ c2 }}; telling the story backward and
forward simultaneously in {{ c3 }}; with a heavy focus on the Minds in {{ c5
}}; and now from a low-tech perspective with intertwined narratives in {{
this_book }}. Each novel brings something fresh to the series while expanding
our understanding of the Culture. {{ the_authors }} ability to reinvent his
approach while maintaining the quality of his storytelling makes him one of my
favorite authors. I can't wait to see what he does in {{ c7 }}.
