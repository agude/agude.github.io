<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>, is the sixth <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> book; but it isn't like a normal
Culture novel: there are no space ships and almost no technology. Instead it
follows Culture citizens DeWar and Vosill as they manipulate a medieval
society.

{{ this_book }} is polarizing: on [goodreads][gr] it has a reader score of
3.95---lower than any other culture novel except {{ c1 }}. I understand why:
the Culture is generally "space opera", and {{ this_book }} has not a single
spaceship, ray gun, or Mind. It reads like standard fantasy with bare hints of
technology. And I loved it.

The title, {{ this_book }}, refers to several different things:

- The book is an _inversion_ of the standard Culture narrative. In {{ c2 }}
  and {{ c3 }}, we saw the Culture manipulate less advanced civilizations from
  the Cultures perspective. In {{ this_book }}, we see it from the perspective
  of the manipulated civilization.

- DeWar and Vosill's ideas of how best to do good _inverts_ in the story.
  Originally, in the stories of their past DeWar tells, DeWar thought you
  sometimes had to do evil for the greater good and Vosill believed you did
  not. In the present, DeWar is a bodyguard who kills only in defense, while
  Vosill is steering the course of the world with manipulation and
  assassination.

- There are many role _inversions_ as well: Vosill is a doctor that kills,
  DeWar is an assassin that protects. The UrLeyn is an oppressive
  anti-monarchist, Quience is a democratizing monarch.

{{ this_book }} is similar to {{ torture }}. Both are sci-fi novels that take
place in a "fantasy world", with hints of but now explicit advanced
technology. A torturer's apprentice is even one of the first characters to
show up in {{ this_book }} when he summons Vossil and Oelph to his master.

I really enjoyed the two stories in {{ this_book }}, which only became clearly
intertwined at the very end. I loved the characters, especially how Vosill's
true nature was revealed at the end when it was insinuated that she was
responsible for all the murders, and that she poisoned the king to set up her
own escape. UrLeyn's descent was also subtle and explained why DeWar did not
see it coming.

My one critique is that rape is the only real violence visited against women
in {{ inversions }}. Perrund takes her revenge on UrLeyn because he murdered
her family and raped her; Vosill is about to be raped before her knife missile
saves her.
