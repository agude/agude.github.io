<cite class="book-title">The Sword of the Lictor</cite> is the third book in
Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun tetralogy. It follows Severian after he
reaches Thrax and is exiled for a second time.

{% include book_link.html title="The Shadow of the Torturer" %} was
overwhelming as I immersed myself in the rich setting and complex writing
style. {% include book_link.html title="The Claw of the Conciliator" %} felt
slower paced as Severian traveled from place to place. In contrast, <cite
class="book-title">The Sword of the Lictor</cite> moved briskly and introduced
fascinating new characters and situations.

Some of my favorite scenes were:

- The haunting confrontation with the Alzabo and Agia at the mountain cottage.
- The mountain carved into a giant statue of Typhon.
- The village of the sorcerers and the "magic" duel.
- Lake Diurna and its lake-dwellers who live on floating islands.
- The castle of Baldanders, his disturbing human experiments, and his fight
  with Severian.

Although the structure of the story resembles {% include
book_link.html title="The Claw of the Conciliator" %}, with Severian traveling
from adventure to adventure, I felt each part was more engaging.

With this book wrapped up, I am eager to dive into the forth book, {% include
book_link.html title="The Citadel of the Autarch" %}.
