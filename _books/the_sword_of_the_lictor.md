<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the third book in <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>'s <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> tetralogy. It follows Severian
after he reaches Thrax and is exiled for a second time.

{{ shadow_torturer }} was overwhelming as I immersed myself in the rich
setting and complex writing style. {{ claw_conciliator }} felt slower paced as
Severian traveled from place to place. In contrast, {{ this_book }} moved
briskly and introduced fascinating new characters and situations.

Some of my favorite scenes were:

- The haunting confrontation with the Alzabo and Agia at the mountain cottage.

- The mountain carved into a giant statue of Typhon.

- The village of the sorcerers and the "magic" duel.

- Lake Diurna and its lake-dwellers who live on floating islands.

- The castle of Baldanders, his disturbing human experiments, and his fight
  with Severian.

Although the structure of the story resembles {{ claw_conciliator }}, with
Severian traveling from adventure to adventure, I felt each part was more
engaging.

With this book wrapped up, I am eager to dive into the fourth book, {{
citadel_autarch }}.
