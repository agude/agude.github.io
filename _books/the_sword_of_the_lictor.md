<span class="book-title">The Sword of the Lictor</span> is the third book in
Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun tetralogy. It starts with Severian
finally reaching Thrax and follows his adventures after his second exile.

{% include book_link.html title="The Shadow of the Torturer" %} felt
overwhelming as I got my head around the setting, got used to the writing
style, and picked up new words from context. {% include book_link.html title="The Claw of the Conciliator" %} felt slow as Severian traveled from
place to place and encounter to encounter. <span class="book-title">The Sword
of the Lictor</span> moved quickly and introduced interesting characters and
situations.

Some of my favorite scenes were:

- The haunting confrontation with the Alzabo and Agia at the mountain cottage.
- The mountain carved as a statue and Typhon.
- The village of the sorcerers and the "magic" duel.
- Lake Diurna with the lake-dwelers living on floating islands.
- The castle of Baldanders, his human abominations, and his and Severians
fight.

Although the structure of the story is very similar to {% include
book_link.html title="The Claw of the Conciliator" %}, with Severian traveling
from adventure to adventure, I thought each part was more engaging.

With this book wrapped up, I feel energized and ready to fly through the forth
book, {% include book_link.html title="The Citadel of the Autarch" %}.
