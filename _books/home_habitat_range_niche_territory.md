{{ this_book }}[^note] takes place immediately after {{ mb4 }}, and is told
from the prospective of  Dr. Ayda Mensah as she defends Murderbot's case as a
refugee to a follow council member, and deals with her own PTSD her near
murder by GrayCris in {{ mb1 }} and kidnapping by them in {{ mb4 }}.

{{ this_book }} focuses more heavily on the theme of mental health and being
than any other book so far in {{ this_series }}. It asks the question: "Can
you separate _who_ you are from _what_ you are and what you've experienced?"
and in doing so compares Murderbot---who was created as a weapon and shaped by
that---to Mensah---whose PTSD has reshaped her. It also focuses much more
clearly on the horror that is the Corporation Rim and their system of slavery
for both their workers---whose bodies are enslaved---and their
constructs---who are enslaved in both body and mind. It made me realize that
SecUnits are akin to <cite class="table-top-game-title">Warhammer
40,000</cite> servitors, although deceptively less grimdark.

What I love about {{ this_series }} is the perfect mix of action and thought
provoking, emotional insight, and {{ the_authors_lastname}} wasn't able to
balance those in {{ this_book }}'s 14 pages as well as in the longer stories.
Still I enjoy the different view of the world. Next, I'm jumping into {{
tchaikovskys }} {{ shards }} for my book club, after which I plan to get back
to {{ mb5 }}.
