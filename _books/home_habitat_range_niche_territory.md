{{ this_book }}[^note] takes place immediately after {{ mb4 }}, and is told
from the perspective of Dr. Ayda Mensah as she gets back to life on
Preservation Station. She is grappling with her own PTSD---stemming from her
near-murder by GrayCris in {{ mb1 }} and kidnapping in {{ mb4 }}---while
trying to navigate politics, pestering reporters, and support Murderbot and
her team.

{{ this_book }} dives deeper into themes of mental health and identity than
any previous entry in {{ this_series }}. It raises the question: "Can you
separate _who_ you are from _what_ you are and what you've experienced?" In
exploring this, it draws a parallel between Murderbot---created as a weapon
and shaped by that---and Mensah, whose trauma has reshaped her as well.

It also more directly confronts the horror of the Corporation Rim, especially
their system of slavery. The story highlights how both their human
workers---enslaved physically---and their constructs---enslaved in both body
and mind---are trapped. It made me realize that SecUnits are basically <cite
class="table-top-game-title">Warhammer 40,000</cite> servitors, just
deceptively less grimdark.

What I love about {{ this_series }} is the perfect mix of action and
emotional, thought-provoking insight. But {{ the_authors_lastname }} doesn't
quite manage to balance those elements in {{ this_book }}'s 14 pages as well
as in the longer installments. Still, I appreciated seeing the world from a
different angle. 

Next up is {{ tchaikovskys }} {{ shards }} for my book club---then I'm heading
back into {{ mb5 }}.
