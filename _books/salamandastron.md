<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the fifth book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It tells the story
of the siege of Salamandastron by Ferahgo the Assassin and the dryditch fever
plague at Redwall.

{{ this_book }} has a few firsts in the series:

- Dingeye and Thura are two vermin who are accepted into Redwall (although
  later betray it, somewhat accidentally)

- Redwall faces a plague instead of an attacking army or evil creature.

- There are multiple different "quests" happening at the same time: Mara and
  Pickle trying to save Salamandastron, Arula and Samkin trying to find
  Martin's sword, and Thrug and dumble trying to find a cure for the fever.

{{ this_book }} features the first real _war_ in the {{ redwall_series }}
series. There have been many battles before, but in this book we see warrior
hares defending their fortress from thousands of vermin. As a full-scale
conflict, far more defenders are killed than during any siege of Redwall. It's
the second time we see the Hares in combat, and unlike {{ mariel }}, they feel
powerful but mortal, with mythical Spartan-like prowess and tragedy.

Ferahgo and his son are good villains, and then tension between them adds some
depth, but they don't really feel new. Which is fine, they're there to be
hated and finally die, which they do fabulously. Of all the characters, I
really enjoyed the falcons and the eagles of the north who speak with a
ridiculous Scottish accent. Doing voices while reading their dialogue was a
lot of fun!

{{ this_book }} feels different from the books that came before. There is
little cross-over with the other novels in the series: most the characters
only appear in this book. The combat feels higher stakes and darker. There
isn't really a main character or hero, but a team of people.

The kids once again loved it, and are looking forward to {{ martin }}.
