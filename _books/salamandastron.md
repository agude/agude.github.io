<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the fifth book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It tells the story
of two parallel conflicts: the siege of Salamandastron by Ferahgo the Assassin
and a devastating plague at Redwall Abbey.

{{ this_book }} breaks new ground in the {{ redwall_series }} series in
several ways:

- For the first time, vermin (Dingeye and Thura) are welcomed into Redwall,
  though they later accidentally betray this trust.

- The Abbey faces an internal threat---a plague---rather than the usual
  external enemies.

- The story follows three parallel quests instead of one: Mara and Pikkle's
  mission to save Salamandastron, Arula and Samkim's search for Martin's sword,
  and Thrugg and Dumble's race to find a cure for the fever.

- The battles feel weighty and damaging, even to the victors.

{{ this_book }} features the first true *war* in the {{ redwall_series }}
series: we witness warrior hares defending their mountain fortress against
thousands of vermin in a full-scale conflict. In the previous Redwall sieges,
the death of a defender was a major, book-defining moment; in the siege of
Salamandastron, hares die with only half a sentence spared to mention it. It
makes the war feel cruel and impersonal. The Long Patrol fought in {{ mariel
}}, but this appearance highlights their mythical, Spartan-like qualities:
heroic, selfless, and willing to fight to the death in service of their
mission.

Ferahgo and his son are fine villains, and their strained relationship adds
some depth, but they come across as a second take on Slagar from {{ mattimeo
}}: tricksters in charge of an army. Still, they fulfill their role as
hateable antagonists who meet satisfying ends.

My favorite characters were the falcons and eagles of the north with their
outrageous Scottish accents. Reading their dialogue aloud was particularly
entertaining for my kids.

{{ this_book }} marks a departure from earlier books in the series. It stands
largely independent, with most characters appearing only in this volume. The
combat is grittier and the stakes feel higher. After the final battle, the
hares and heroes look around at the carnage and realize with horror what
they've done, something brand new in a series that typically treats battles as
relatively clean affairs where characters may die but the violence itself is
glossed over.

The kids once again loved it, and are looking forward to {{ martin }}.
