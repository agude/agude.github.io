{{ this_series }} reminds me of my childhood. My dad read the series as a kid,
and he read them to me and my siblings when we were growing up. Now I'm
reading them---from the same stack of worn-out books that he bought us---to my
kids. So far, they're loving it!

The art in {{ this_book }} is beautiful. {{ the_author }}'s precise [_ligne
claire_][lc] style works perfectly for drawing detailed, lifelike
backgrounds---from sweeping mountain landscapes, to scientific equipment like
the atomic pile, to the iconic red-and-white rocket on the cover.

The plot is a little slow. There's some great slapstick with Captain Haddock
and Calculus, though Thomson and Thompson are more subdued (but the kids loved
the skeleton gag!). And there is _a lot_ of text. {{ the_author }} wanted this
story to feel realistic, and that meant having the characters explain in
detail how the rocket and all the science behind it actually works. The
antagonists are carefully developed, and come across as a real threat with
their various successes in spying on---and sabotaging---the project.

Just like my siblings, my kids are hooked! We're moving right on to {{ tt17
}}.
