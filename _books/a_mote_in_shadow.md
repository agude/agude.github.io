<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>'s debut novel. It follows
two down-on-their-luck outsiders dragged into a war between shadowy mercenary
groups: exobiologist Chaeyoung No, whose disagreement with the scientific
establishment leaves her in no position to question a too-good-to-be-true
offer to fund her research expedition; and space hauler Frederik Obialo, who
is more than willing to take a dangerous jobs if it brings him closer to his
dream of giving his daughter a permanent home.

{{ this_book }} is a "hard sci-fi techno-thriller". It feels like {{ clancys
}} work, but not from the operator or spy perspective; it's told from the view
of civilians dragged into the conflict. The plot is hard to follow, but I
think that's the point: Chaeyoung and Frederik have no idea why governments
and mercenary groups keep hiring them, double-crossing them, or holding them
hostage.[^plot] They're a lot like Daniel Br√ºks in {{ echopraxia }}: they
understand the least about what's really going on.

[^plot]:
    ### Chaeyoung's Storyline:

    Chaeyoung, an exobiologist, is hired by Acheron Private Capital Group to
    investigate the Mu Herculis system. Her expedition discovers an alien
    derelict but is ambushed by the rival mercenary outfit, Grayson Services
    Group. Chaeyoung and her love interest, Vis, are captured together.
    Grayson takes them to a secret base where they are forced to work on
    advanced faster-than-light drives. Vis is rescued by United Planets Navy
    Shades. Chaeyoung and the two other captive physicists (Mimo and Ali) are
    moved to the planetoid Tritonis Prime, where they are forced to
    reverse-engineer a powerful alien artifact: a Closed Timelike Curve
    Computer (CTCC), likely built by a second, more advanced alien species.

    In a desperate sabotage attempt, Mimo triggers an explosion that unleashes
    a xenoform plague from the CTCC: a self-replicating ferrofluid that
    transforms victims into monstrous creatures. Chaeyoung escapes the chaos
    and is rescued by the Shades, whom she convinces to destroy the
    installation. The Shades go rogue after learning their leader is going to
    be blamed, and Chaeyoung joins them.

    ### Frederik's Storyline:

    Meanwhile, the covert United Planets unit, the Shades, use a front company
    to hire freighter captain Frederik Obialo. His mission is to transport
    their operatives and a rescued VIP (Vis) to a safe house. His ship, the
    _Ergo Infinitum_, is ambushed by Grayson operatives who attach themselves
    to the hull during a cargo pickup. The crew manages to warn the safe
    house, leading to a firefight that destroys it but ends with a few Shades,
    including one named Omolara, making it to the ship. Omolara gives Vis a
    prototype CTCC (built by the physicists before their capture).

    The crew is then betrayed by one of their own, Kirk, who disables their
    ship and hands them over to Grayson's warship, the _Delightful Death_. The
    warship is suddenly attacked by metallic, crystalline aliens, possibly
    drawn to the CTCC. In the chaos, Frederik, the survivors of his crew, and
    the Shades escape in a shuttle.

The character writing is excellent. I was rooting for Chaeyoung and Vis,
hoping they'd survive and reunite. I wanted Frederik to make it back to his
daughter. And the villains, Sato and Ninya Blanca, were so evil I **hated**
them. Their presence was overpowering---I felt scared and tense whenever they
showed up, imagining what atrocity they were about to commit.

But there are signs of unfinished edits. Sometimes it felt like a sentence or
two was missing, or that both an old and a new version of a sentence ended up
in the draft. Still, it never made me cringe the way {{ house_suns }} or {{
shards }} did.

The worldbuilding is unique and deep, but not overdone. The way society is
structured around unbreakable quantum encryption makes sense, and it ties
directly into the core conflict. At the same time, {{ the_author }} throws in
all sorts of smaller details that make the setting feel alive: different waves
to indicate your pronouns when meeting someone; robots that shift genders as
they speak; automated systems that act less like clean, logical sci-fi AIs and
more like modern, hallucinating LLMs.

This book reminded me of a few works. The Closed Timelike Curve computers that
can break any encryption made me think of {{ sneakers }} and its black box
that could hack anything. The solving of the Fermi Paradox---with
oxygen---made me think of how {{ taylor }} handles it in {{ lost }} with an
alien federation that annexed everyone and then left, and how {{ liu }}
approaches it in {{ three_body }} with hostile aliens. Cryptographic seals
brought me back to the seals and (weak) encryption on infofeches in {{
martines }} {{ memory_empire }}, and even more so to the cryptographic
memories in {{ rajaniemis }} {{ quantum_thief }}. And the way the narrative
flips between two timelines to preserve its surprises is like {{ banks }} {{
use_weapons }}.

The alien side of things reflected other works too. The spooky ruins, the
ferrofluid plague, and especially the multi-armed metal aliens near the end
reminded me of Rorschach and the Scramblers in {{ blindsight }}. The infected
humans from the plague felt like the Flood from {{ halo }} or the xenomorph
infection in {{ aliens_movie }}. Continuing the video game theme, I kept
picturing the Gray Top and the Absolute Horizons commandos as Raul Kortenaer
and the Krenel mercs from {{ disco_elysium }}; Krenel, with its roster of
sadistic war criminals given free rein to rape and murder, would have fit
right into this story's brutal disregard for human life. And the "blacker than
black" Shade suits brought Fuligin to mind, the blacker-than-black worn by
Severian in {{ wolfe }} {{ botns }}.

Finally, the importance of time and distance---how Earth failed to govern its
far-off colonies because it had to predict events months or years in
advance---reminded me of the Shardlings in {{ reynoldss }} {{ house_suns }},
forced to rely on actuarial estimates to guess whether their destinations
would still exist 50,000 years later.

I really enjoyed {{ the_authors }} debut novel. Sci-fi is my favorite genre,
and techno-thrillers are probably my second, so combining the two was perfect
for me. I'm excited to see where he takes the universe next, and what happens
to Chaeyoung and Vis now that they've joined the Shades.

Up next is {{ simmonss }} {{ hyperion }} for my book club. I'm looking forward
to giving it a second read, as it's such a deep book, full of references to
other literature and packed with themes and motifs I missed the first time.
