{{ this_book }} was one of the first sci-fi books I discovered in my middle
school library. I don't recall how I stumbled upon it, but I'm lucky that I
did. It sparked my love for {{ book_author }}, sci-fi, and reading in general.

The book's primary theme is spiritual, but explored through a paranormal and
sci-fi lens. It presents {{ clarke }}'s version of the evangelical
[rapture][rapture]: God sends angels to Earth to shepherd humanity into
heaven, leaving behind those deemed unworthy. The angels themselves are
fallen---forbidden from entering heaven---and thus have a demonic appearance.

[rapture]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture

The actual story is that aliens appear over Earth. After [6 days][sixth_day],
they contact humanity, identifying themselves as "the Overlords". They usher
in a golden age of peace and prosperity, but at the cost of stifling
creativity, while keeping their true nature hidden. Eventually, the Overlords
reveal their demonic appearance: horns, wings, cloven hooves, and barbed
tails.

[sixth_day]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative

Roughly a century after the Overlords' arrival, human children develop psychic
powers, transcend into a collective consciousness, and leave the adults behind
to join the Overmind. The Overlords, due to some biological limitation, are
unable to transcend themselves and instead travel the galaxy helping other
species achieve transcendence.

{{ book_author }}'s writing style is crisp and clear, allowing him to convey
multiple storylines within only 200 pages through efficient sentences and
occasional shifts to an omniscient narrator perspective to depict broad
changes. While this approach can feel lazy with other authors---telling
instead of showing---{{ clarke }} employs it skillfully.

{{ the_book }} is highly influential. At one point, the children use
clairvoyance to witness various places in the galaxy. One scene directly
references {{ flatland }}, depicting 2D life crushed flat by gravity.
Another---with six stars[^six_stars], a chaotically orbiting planet, and life
that survives extreme freeze-thaw cycles---clearly inspired {{ liu_cixin }}
Trisolarians in {{ three_body }}. The group mind made up of people who have
lost their individuality is also explored by {{ peter_watts }} in {{
echopraxia }}.

[^six_stars]: 
    > It was a world that could never know the meaning of night and day, of
    > years or seasons. Six colored suns shared its sky, so that there came
    > only a change of light, never darkness. Through the clash and tug of the
    > conflicting gravitational fields, the planet traveled along the loops
    > and curves of its inconceivably complex orbit, never tracing the same
    > path. Every moment was unique: the configuration which the six suns now
    > held in the heavens would not repeat itself this side of eternity.
    >
    > And even here there was life. Though the planet might be scorched by the
    > central fires of one age, and frozen in the outer reach in another, it
    > was yet the home of intelligence. The great, many-faceted crystals stood
    > grouped in intricate geometrical patterns, motionless in the eras of
    > cold, growing slowing along the veins of mineral when the world was warm
    > again.
