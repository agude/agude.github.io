{{ this_book }} was one of---if not the---first sci-fi books I pulled off the
shelf of my middle school library. I don't know how I found it, but I'm lucky
I did. That was the start of my love of {{ book_author }}, of my love of
sci-fi, and my love of reading.

The book's primary theme is spiritual, but through a paranormal and sci-fi
lens. It is {{ clarke }}'s version of the evangelical [rapture][rapture]: God
(the Overmind) sends fallen angels (the Overlords) to Earth to shepherd
humanity into heaven (transcend and joined with the Overmind) while leaving
some behind (those who are too old for their minds to transcend). The angles
themselves are forbidden from heaven (their own race does not have the psychic
ability to). Of course, as fallen angels barred from heaven, the Overlords
look exactly like biblical demons.

Of course the actual story is that aliens appear over Earth, but keep their
appearance hidden. Humanity enters a golden age and after 50 years.
