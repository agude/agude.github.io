{{ this_book }} was one of---if not the---first sci-fi books I pulled off the
shelf of my middle school library. I don't know how I found it, but I'm lucky
I did. That was the start of my love of {{ book_author }}, of my love of
sci-fi, and my love of reading.

The book's primary theme is spiritual, but through a paranormal and sci-fi
lens. It is {{ clarke }}'s version of the evangelical [rapture][rapture]: God
sends angels to Earth to shepherd humanity into heaven, leaving behind those
who are unworthy. The angels themselves are fallen---they are forbidden from
entering heaven themselves---and hence demonic in appearance.

The actual story is that aliens appear over Earth. After [6 days][sixth_day]
they contact humanity, informing us that they are "the Overlords". They usher
in a golden age of peace and prosperity at the cost of creativity, all the
while keeping themselves hidden. The Overlords eventually show themselves,
revealing their demonic appearance: horns, wings, cloven hooves, barbed tails.

Roughly a hundred years after the arrival of the Overlords, human children
develop psychic powers, transcend into a group mind, and leave the adults
behind to join the Overmind. The Overlords, due to some biological quirk, are
unable to transcend themselves and instead travel the galaxy helping other
species do so.

{{ book_author }}'s writing is crisp and clear, allowing him to fit multiple
stories in only 200 pages through efficient sentences and pulling back to an
omniscient narrator view at times to tell us big picture changes. This writing
_can_ feel lazy with other authors---why tell us what humanity is feeling
instead of giving us characters to show it?---but {{ clarke }} makes it work
beautifully.

At one point the children view various places in the galaxy through
clairvoyance. One of these scenes is a direct reference to {{ flatland }},
with 2D life crushed flat by gravity. Another---with six stars[^six_stars], a
chaotically orbiting plant, and life they has to survive extreme freeze-thaw
cycles---is a clear inspiration for {{ liu_cixin }} Trisolarians in {{
three_body }}.

[^six_stars]: 
    > It was a world that could never know the meaning of night and day, of
    > years or seasons. Six colored suns shared its sky, so that there came
    > only a change of light, never darkness. Through the clash and tug of the
    > conflicting gravitational fields, the planet traveled along the loops
    > and curves of its inconceivably complex orbit, never tracing the same
    > path. Every moment was unique: the configuration which the six suns now
    > held in the heavens would not repeat itself this side of eternity.
    >
    > And even here there was life. Though the planet might be scorched by the
    > central fires of one age, and frozen in the outer reach in another, it
    > was yet the home of intelligence. The great, many-faceted crystals stood
    > grouped in intricate geometrical patterns, motionless in the eras of
    > cold, growing slowing along the veins of mineral when the world was warm
    > again.
