{{ this_book }} was one of---if not the---first sci-fi books I pulled off the
shelf of my middle school library. I don't know how I found it, but I'm lucky
I did. That was the start of my love of {{ book_author }}, of my love of
sci-fi, and my love of reading.

The book's primary theme is spiritual, but through a paranormal and sci-fi
lens. It is {{ clarke }}'s version of the evangelical [rapture][rapture]: God
sends angels to Earth to shepherd humanity into heaven, leaving behind those
who aren't worthy. The angels themselves are fallen---they are forbidden from
entering heaven themselves---hence their physical appearance exactly matches
biblical demons.

Of course the actual story is that aliens appear over Earth, but keep their
appearance hidden. Humanity enters a golden age and after 50 years.
