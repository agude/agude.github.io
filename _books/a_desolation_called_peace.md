{{ this_book }} continues right where {{ teix1 }} left off: it takes place a
few months after the end of the first book, it follows the same characters,
and continues and expands the same themes and motifs.

The theme of "What is the definition of _you_?" carries over from {{ teix1 }}.
In the first book, this question explored Mahit's identity, expanded by her
chain of memories from the Imago Machine, the group-mind Sunlit, and even the
homogonizing culture of the Teixcalaanli Empire. In this book, {{ the_author
}} introduces the hive-mind aliens---connected through parasitic fungus---and
the share pilots---forming a group-mind with each other through their
ships---as further examples challenging the definition of an individual
"_you_". This exploration reminded me of {{ wattss }} {{ firefall }} series.
The {{ this_series }} shares its theme about the nature of consciousness with
{{ blindsight }}, and the way {{ this_book }} builds on the themes of its
predecessor feels similar to how {{ echopraxia }} expands on {{ blindsight }}.

{{ this_book }} also continues the starchart motif, but expands it, focusing
more tightly to the similarities to neural networks. Examples include the ship
captain as a brain for their ship, the fractal tattoos of Twenty Cicada, and
the branching, connected patterns of the parasitic alien fungus.

Although I enjoyed the first contact with hostile aliens plot line more than
the courtly intrigue of {{ teix1 }}, the relationship development between
Mahit and Three Seagrass felt weaker here. {{ the_author }} used a fairly
standard romance trope---breaking the characters apart with a misunderstanding
before having them reconcile later---that felt out of place because {{
this_book }} isn't _really_ a romance novel.

One thing I liked was how effectively the book made me dislike the Lsel
council while sympathizing with the Teixcalaanli Empire and its people. This
mirrored Mahit's own feelings in the novel: her longing to join the Empire and
be with Three Seagrass makes her an outcast at home.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of several other pieces of science fiction:

- The aliens call their ships "starflyers," similar to the alien species in {{
  hamiltons }} {{ pandoras_star }} and {{ jusdas_unchained }}. The aliens in
  both series are hive minds, and in both stories, humans consider genocide
  against the aliens and are conflicted about it.

- The hive mind aliens share similarities with the Buggers from {{ enders_game
  }}. Ender commits genocide by destroying the Buggers' homeworld and later
  regrets it, while in {{ this_book }}, the genocide is ultimately averted.

- Twenty Cicada's tattoos are similar to Lededje Y'breq's patterned skin in {{
  bankss }} {{ surface_detail }}.

- The Emperor's throne made of spears is reminiscent of the iconic Iron Throne
  made of swords in {{ grrms }} {{ game_of_thrones }}.

- The furry pets that overrun the air vents of the ship _Weight for the Wheel_
  are a deliberate homage to the Tribbles from <span
  class="tv-show-title">Star Trek</span>.

- Early in their history, the Teixcalaanli empire sent a poet to establish
  first contact with the Ebrektia race. They later regretted this choice
  because the poet sent back no useful scientific observations, leading to the
  sentiment: "We sent a poet where we ought to have sent a team of _ixplanatl_
  researchers." This line directly references the movie <span
  class="movie-title">Contact</span>, which was based on {{ sagans }} novel {{
  contact }}.
