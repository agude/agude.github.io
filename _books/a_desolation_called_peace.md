{{ this_book }} picks up right where {{ teix1 }} left off: a few months after
the events of the first book, following the same characters, and continuing to
develop the same themes and motifs.

The theme of "What is the definition of _you_?" carriers over from {{ teix1
}}. In the first book, "_you_" was expanded to Mahit with her chain of
memories from the Imago machine, the group-mind of the Sunlit, and even the
culture of the Teixcalaanli Empire itself. In this book, {{ the_author }} adds
new examples: the alien hive-mind connected together through a parasitic
fungus, and the shard pilots who form a group-mind with each other through
their ships. This exploration of "_you_" reminded my most of {{ wattss }} {{
firefall }} series: both focus on what constitutes a "mind", and the way {{
this_book }} expands on {{ teix1 }} feels similar to how {{ echopraxia }}
builds on {{ blindsight }}.

{{ this_book }} also continues the starchart motif, but focuses it more
explicitly on neural networks and patterns in the brain. The captain is
described as the brain of their ship, there are the fractal tattoos of Twenty
Cicada, and the branching mycelium of the alien fungus.

Although I enjoyed the first contact with hostile aliens plotline more than
the courtly intrigue of {{ teix1 }}, the relationship between Mahit and Three
Seagrass felt less well developed. {{ the_author }} uses a standard romance
move here---breaking the characters apart with a misunderstanding before
reconciling them later---but it felt out of place because {{ this_book }}
isn't _really_ a romance novel.

One thing I really appreciated was how much the author made me hate the Lsel
council but like the Teixcalaanli Empire and its people. It mirrored Mahit's
feelings in the novel: she longs to be part of the Empire and to be with Three
Seagrass, which makes her an outcast in her own home.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of several other pieces of science fiction:

- The aliens call their ships starflyers, like the alien in {{ hamiltons }} {{
  pandoras_star }} and {{ jusdas_unchained }}. Both books feature hive-mind
  aliens, and in both, humans consider genocide as a possible solution but are
  conflicted about it.

- The hive mind aliens are also like the Buggers from {{ enders_game }}. Ender
  commits genocide by destroying the Buggers' homeworld and regrets it, while
  in {{ this_book }} the genocide is narrowly averted.

- Twenty Cicada's tattoos recall the patterned skin of Lededje Y'breq in {{
  bankss }} {{ surface_detail }}.

- The Emperor's throne of spears is a bit like the iron throne made of swords
  in {{ grrms }} {{ game_of_thrones }}.

- The furry pets that have overrun the _Weight for the Wheel_'s air vents are
  an homage to the Tribbles from <span class="tv-show-title">Star Trek</span>.

- The Teixcalaanli Empire sent a poet to establish first contact with the
  Ebrektia and regretted it when the poet sent back no scientific
  observations, leading to the line: "We sent a poet where we ought to have
  sent a team of _ixplanatl_ researchers"---a reference to the movie <span
  class="movie-title">Contact</span>, based on {{ sagans }} novel {{ contact
  }}.
