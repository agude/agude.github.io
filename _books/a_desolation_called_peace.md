{{ this_book }} picks up right where {{ teix1 }} left off: it is set a few
months after the events of the first book, follows the same characters, and
deepens the themes and motifs introduced earlier.

The question "What is the definition of _you_?" continues to resonate from {{
teix1 }}. In the first book, this inquiry explored Mahit's identity, enriched
by her chain of memories from the Imago Machine, the group-mind Sunlit, and
even the homogenizing culture of the Teixcalaanli Empire. In this installment,
{{ the_author }} introduces new examples of collective consciousness through
hive-mind aliens---linked by a parasitic fungus---and share pilots who merge
minds with their ships, further challenging the notion of an individual
"_you_". This exploration reminded me of {{ wattss }} {{ firefall }} series.
The {{ this_series }} shares its thematic concerns about the nature of
consciousness with {{ blindsight }}, while the way {{ this_book }} builds on
its predecessor is similar to how {{ echopraxia }} expands on {{ blindsight
}}.

{{ this_book }} also revisits the starchart motif, but with a sharper focus on
its similarities to neural networks. This is evident in elements such as the
ship captain acting as a brain for the vessel, the fractal tattoos of Twenty
Cicada, and the branching, interconnected patterns of the parasitic alien
fungus.

While I preferred the initial exploration of hostile first contact over the
courtly intrigue of {{ teix1 }}, the romantic development between Mahit and
Three Seagrass felt less compelling here. {{ the_author }} employs a fairly
standard romance trope---separating the characters with a misunderstanding
before reuniting them---that seems out of place in a story that isn't
fundamentally a romance.

One aspect I appreciated was how effectively the book made me dislike the Lsel
council while sympathizing with the Teixcalaanli Empire and its people. This
mirrors Mahit's internal conflict: her longing to join the Empire and be with
Three Seagrass leaves her feeling like an outcast at home.

{{ this_book }} evoked memories of several other pieces of science fiction:

- The aliens refer to their ships as "starflyers," reminiscent of the alien
  species in {{ hamiltons }} {{ pandoras_star }} and {{ jusdas_unchained }}.
  In both series, the aliens operate as hive minds, and humans grapple with
  the ethical dilemma of potential genocide against them.

- The hive-mind aliens draw parallels with the Buggers from {{ enders_game }}.
  While Ender ultimately destroys the Buggers' homeworld and later regrets his
  actions, {{ this_book }} shows a scenario where genocide is narrowly
  avoided.

- Twenty Cicada's tattoos recall the patterned skin of Lededje Y'breq in {{
  bankss }} {{ surface_detail }}.

- The Emperor's throne, fashioned from spears, brings to mind the iconic Iron
  Throne made of swords in {{ grrms }} {{ game_of_thrones }}.

- The furry pets that overrun the air vents of the ship _Weight for the Wheel_
  serve as a deliberate homage to the Tribbles from <span
  class="tv-show-title">Star Trek</span>.

- Early in their history, the Teixcalaanli Empire sent a poet to make first
  contact with the Ebrektia race. They later regretted this choice when the
  poet returned with no useful scientific observations, leading to the
  sentiment: "We sent a poet where we ought to have sent a team of _ixplanatl_
  researchers." This line directly references the movie <span
  class="movie-title">Contact</span>, which was based on {{ sagans }} novel {{
  contact }}.
