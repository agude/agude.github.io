{{ this_book }} continues right where {{ teix1 }} left off: it takes place a
few months after the end of the first book, it follows the same characters,
and continues and expands the same themes and motifs.

The theme of "What is the definition of _you_?" continues from {{ teix1 }}. In
the first book, "_you_" was expanded to Mahit with her chain of memories from
the Imago machine, the group-mind of the Sunlit, and even the culture of the
Teixcalaanli Empire. In this book, {{ the_author }} adds the hive-mind of the
aliens---connected together through a parasitic fungus---and the shard
pilots---forming a group-mind with each other through their ships---as further
examples of different types of "_you_". In this way, the {{ this_series }}
reminded me most of {{ wattss }} {{ firefall }}: there is the common theme of
what is a "mind" that is explored in {{ blindsight }}, and the way {{
echopraxia }} builds on and expands the themes from {{ blindsight }} is
similar as well.

{{ this_book }} also continues the starchart motif, but expands it to more
tightly focus on the similarities to neural networks in the brain. We see the
captain described as the brain of their ship, there are the fractal tattoos of
Twenty Cicada, and the branching patterns of the mycelium of the parasitic
fungus.

Although I enjoyed the first contact with hostile aliens plot line more than
the courtly intrigue of {{ teix1 }}, the relationship between Mahit and Three
Seagrass wasn't as well developed. {{ the_author }} used a standard romance
trick---breaking the characters apart with a misunderstanding before having
them reconcile later---that felt out of place because {{ this_book }} isn't
_really_ a romance novel.

One thing I like was how much I hated the Lsel council but liked the
Teixcalaanli Empire and its people. It mirrored the way Mahit felt in the
novel, with a longing to join the Empire and Three Seagrass which made her an
outcast at home.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of others pieces of science fiction:

- The aliens call their ships starflyers, like the alien in {{ hamiltons }} {{
  pandoras_star }} and {{ jusdas_unchained }}. The aliens in both books are
  hive minds, and in both the humans consider a genocide against the aliens
  and are conflicted about it.

- The hive mind aliens are like the buggers from {{ enders_game }}. Ender
  commits genocide by destroying the buggers' homeworld and regrets it, while
  in {{ this_book }} the genocide is averted.

- The throne of spear is a bit like the iron throne made of swords in {{ grrms
  }} {{ game_of_thrones }}.

- The furry pets that have taken over the _Weight for the Wheel_'s air vents is a
  homage to the Tribbles from <span class="tv-show-title">Star Trek</span>.

- The Teixcalaan empire sent a poet to establish first contact with the
  Ebrektia and regretted it because the poet sent back no scientific
  observations, leading to them saying: "We sent a poet where we ought to have
  sent a team of _ixplanatl_ researchers", a reference to the movie <span
  class="movie-title">Contact</span>, based on {{ sagans }} {{ contact }}.
