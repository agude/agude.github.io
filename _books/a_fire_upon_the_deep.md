I first read {{ this_book }}, and the prequel {{ deepness }}, about 20 years
ago and loved it. {{ this_book }} was one of the last books I read before
college and grad school caused me to stop reading fiction due to lack of time.
So I was excited to pick this book up again when my book club voted to read
it, curious to see how it compared to my memory of it.

In short, I still love it. The ideas are incredibly thought-provoking, the
characters all have unique personalities, and the story keeps moving without
slow spots. It's one of the best books I've read, behind only {{ blindsight }}
and {{ echopraxia }} so far in my list.

### Zones of Thought

The core idea in {{ this_book }} is that the galaxy is divided into "zones of
thought". There are four concentric zones, starting at the core of the galaxy
and working their way outward:

- The **Unthinking Depths**: The area around the galactic core where basic
  intelligence is not possible.
- The **Slow Zone**: A place where biological intelligence is possible, but
  not true artificial intelligence. Faster than light communication and travel
  are impossible, but some civilizations travel the stars using cryogenic
  sleep and Bussard ramjets. Advanced technology generally stops working after
  a time.
- The **Beyond**: The location of the most advanced civilizations, where AI,
  FTL travel, and anti-gravity technology allow miracles of science.
- The **Transcend**: The zone where super-intelligences are possible, and the
  place where civilizations that transcend to become Powers move to. The
  Blight and the Old One are from here.

Some characters in the book believe that although the zones seem detrimental
to life, they actually allow civilizations to be born and flourish, protected
from more powerful entities by the zone boundaries---like fish protected from
predators by the crushing depth of the ocean.

{{ this_book }} shows this theory to be overstated, as the Blight freely
crosses from the Transcend into the Beyond, and is still able to destroy
multiple Powers and hundreds of civilizations. The main protagonists, humans
attempting to stop the Blight, travel from the high Beyond to the low Beyond
and into the Slow Zone, where even their limited technology gives them a
decisive advantage. This theme of more powerful entities crossing zone
boundaries and influencing less advanced realms is central to the book's plot
and conflicts.

### The Blight

The Blight is an ancient evil, defeated five billion years ago and
accidentally revived by humans tricked by an archive they discovered in the
Transcend.

Although the Blight is the main and largest threat, it remains in the
background for most of the book. The story of the war is primarily told
through newsgroup postings,[^ender] and so comes off as distant, clinical, and
cold even as trillions die or are enslaved and solar systems are destroyed.
One of the posts even berates the other posters for their obsession with a
local event that just isn't that important to the rest of the galaxy.

[^ender]:
    Like the newsgroups in {{ ender }}, it feels a little dated that the
    exact same communication paradigm that happened to be popular when the
    book was written persists billions of years into the future.

This approach makes the few times that the protagonists are directly attacked
feel sudden and tense, because they otherwise are safely removed from the war
itself. When Relay is attacked and destroyed, the chapter starts out calm,
with the protagonists literally on the beach, and ends with the death of a
Power, the destruction of the system, and a mad escape in a half-ready ship.
There is real tension because you know how strong the Blight is.

By putting the war in the background, the story feels close and personal,
while still conveying high stakes and huge impact---just like {{ torturer }}.
This contrasts with novels like {{ phlebas }}, where the war is put
front-and-center to emphasize the insignificance of individuals in the face of
galactic conflicts.

{{ this_book }} makes the universe feel old, with forgotten history and
ancient evils, in a way {{ suns }} failed to do.

### The Tines

The Tines are a race of dog-like creatures. The individual members are not
particularly smart, but they form sentient hivemind packs by connecting
multiple members together through high-frequency sound. This is similar to the
Bicamerals in {{ echopraxia }}, in which we see that a mind is not limited to
a physical structure, but can be any system connected together with high
enough bandwidth.

In fact, both the {{ firefall }} series and {{ this_book }} operate under a
similar rule: that intelligence is the ultimate advantage. A smarter adversary
will almost certainly come out on top, as seen with the various transhumans in
{{ wattss }} book and the Powers in {{ the_authors }} work.

But despite their alienness, the Tines suffer from being too human in
motivation. This is a common problem, seen with the Mesklinite in {{ gravity
}}, the Cheela in {{ dragons_egg }}, and the spiders in {{ deepness }}. Only
{{ eater }} really succeeded in making something that did not feel human,
although other books---like {{ river }}---excuse their human-like aliens by
arguing that evolution forces those traits.

The Tines, specifically Flenser and Steel, are the "street-level bad guys" in
{{ this_book }}. They obviously pale in comparison to the Blight, but when
they slaughter Johanna and Jefri's parents and schoolmates, it feels worse
than when the Blight kills billions in the background because of how close and
personal it is.

Half of the main story takes place on the Tines' world. It focuses on the
human children Johanna and Jefri Olsndot, who are separated after their ship
crashes on the planet. Each child is taken in by rival Tine packs: Johanna by
Woodcarver's more benevolent group, and Jefri by the ruthless Steel. This
parallel storyline provides a close-up view of Tine society and politics,
while also exploring how the arrival of advanced human technology impacts
their medieval-level civilization. It grounds the novel by providing simple,
human-scale consequences to an otherwise incomprehensibly vast war.

### The _Out of Band II_

The other half of the main storyline follows the _Out of Band II_, or the
_OOB_, as it races away from the Blight towards the Tines' homeworld, trying
to retrieve a countermeasure that could save the galaxy from the Blight. On
the ship are:

- Pham Nuwen: a human constructed by the Power "Old One" to serve as his
  presence in the Beyond, and who now suffers moments of insight even though
  Old One was destroyed.
- Ravna Bergsndot: a human librarian and applied theologist.
- Blueshell and Greenstalk: Sentient aquatic plants that ride around in
  "Skrodes" that also enhance their limited short-term memory.

They barely escape the attack on Relay by the Blight and begin their desperate
attempt to reach the Tineworld. On the way they attract the attention of
genocidal butterflies who blame the humans for the Blight, as well as the
Blight itself. They are also betrayed by the Skroderiders, who it turns out
were created by the Blight 5 billion years prior to act as a [fifth
column][5th_column].

[5th_column]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column

One of the themes of {{ this_book }} is autonomy and the loss of it. Pham is
puppeted by a Power, and even after the Power is destroyed the "god shatter"
controls his actions some of the time. The Skroderiders likewise are taken over
by the Blight, with Greenstalk being used to try to assassinate Pham. Similarly,
each Tine is an amalgamation of multiple "individuals", each controlled by the
whole, but also influenced by the personalities that make up the whole. Even
Steel and Flenser's machinations can be seen as a primitive form of thought
control.

{{ this_book }} does an excellent job of introducing fascinating
ideas---the zones, the Tines, the Powers---with really well-written
characters where everyone feels unique, with different personalities and
motivations. It is one of my favorite books!
