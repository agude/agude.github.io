The core idea in {{ this_book }} is that the galaxy is divided into "zones of
thought". There are four, concentric zones, starting at the core of the galaxy
and working their way outward:

- The **Unthinking Depths**: The area around the galactic core where basic
  intelligence is not possible.
- The **Slow Zone**: A place where biological intelligence is possible, but
  not true artificial intelligence. Faster than light communication and travel
  are impossible, but some civilizations travel the stars using cryogenic
  sleep and Bussard ramjets. Advanced technology generally stops working after
  a time.
- The **Beyond**: The location of the most advanced civilizations, where AI,
  FTL travel, and anti-gravity technology allow miracles of science.
- The **Transcend**: The zone where super-intelligences are possible, and the
  place where civilizations that transcend to become Powers move to. The
  Blight and the Old One are from here.

The book revolves around beings from different zones crossing the boundaries
into lower zones, and how they still maintain superiority while having to
adapt to the new conditions.

{{ this_book }} is about the Blight---an evil Power from the transcendence
that has the Blight outbreak.
