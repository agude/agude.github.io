I first read {{ this_book }} (and the prequel {{ deepness }}) about 20 years
ago. I loved it then. {{ this_book }} was one of the last books I read before
college and grad school caused me to stop reading fiction. So I was excited to
pick this book up again when my book club voted to read it to see how it
compared to my memory of it.

In short, I still love it. The ideas are so mind-expanding <!-- TODO: Better
word -->, the characters all have unique personalities, and the story keeps
moving without slow spots. One of the best books I've read, behind only {{
blindsight }} and {{ echopraxia }} so far in my list.

### Zones of Thought

The core idea in {{ this_book }} is that the galaxy is divided into "zones of
thought". There are four, concentric zones, starting at the core of the galaxy
and working their way outward:

- The **Unthinking Depths**: The area around the galactic core where basic
  intelligence is not possible.
- The **Slow Zone**: A place where biological intelligence is possible, but
  not true artificial intelligence. Faster than light communication and travel
  are impossible, but some civilizations travel the stars using cryogenic
  sleep and Bussard ramjets. Advanced technology generally stops working after
  a time.
- The **Beyond**: The location of the most advanced civilizations, where AI,
  FTL travel, and anti-gravity technology allow miracles of science.
- The **Transcend**: The zone where super-intelligences are possible, and the
  place where civilizations that transcend to become Powers move to. The
  Blight and the Old One are from here.

Some characters in the book believe that although the zones seem detrimental,
they actually are the thing that allows civilizations to be born and flourish,
protected from move powerful entities by the zone boundaries---like fish
protected from predators by the crushing depth of the ocean.

{{ this_book }} shows this theory to be overstated, as the Blight freely cross
from the Transcend into the Beyond, and is still able to destroy multiple
Powers and hundreds of civilizations. Even the main protagonists, humans
attempting to stop the blight, travel from the high Beyond to the low Beyond
and into the Slow Zone, where even their limited technology gives them a
decisive advantage.

### The Blight

The Blight is an ancient evil, defeated five billion years ago and
accidentally revived by humans tricked by an archive they discovered in the
Transcend.

Although the Blight is the main and largest threat, it is in the background
for most of the book. The story of the war is only really told through
newsgroup postings,[^ender] and so comes off as distant, clinical, and cold even as
trillions die or are enslaved and solar systems are destroyed. One of the
posts even berates the other posters for their obsession with a local event
that just isn't that important to the rest of the galaxy.

[^ender]:
    Like the newsgroups {{ ender }}, it feels a little dated that the
    exact same communication paradime that happened to be popular when the
    book was written persist billions of years into the future.

This makes the few times that the protagonists are directly attacked feel
sudden and tense, because they otherwise are safely removed from the way
itself. When Relay is attacked and destroy, the chapter starts out calm, with
the protagonists literally on the beach, and ends with the death of a Power,
the destruction of the system, and mad escape in a half-ready ship. There is
real tension because you know how strong the Blight is.

By put the way in the background, the story feels small and personal, but with
high stakes and a huge impact---just like {{ torturer }} and the opposite of
{{ phlebas }}.

{{ this_book }} also makes the universe feel old, with forgotten history and
ancient evils, in a way {{ suns }} failed to do.

### The Tines

The Tines are a race of of dog-like creatures. The individual members are not
particularly smart, but they form sentient hivemind packs by connecting
multiple members together through high-frequency sound. This is similar to the
Bicamerals in {{ echopraxia }}, in which we see that a mind is not limited to
a physical structure, but can be any system connected together with high
enough bandwidth.

In fact, both {{ echopraxia }} and {{ this_book }} operate under a similar
rule: that intelligence is the ultimate advantage. Smarter adversary will
almost certainly come out on top, as seen with the various transhumans in {{
wattss }} book and the Powers in {{ the_authors }} work.

But despite their alienness, the Tines suffer from being too human in
motivation. This is a common problems, seen with the Mesklinite in {{ gravity
}}, the Cheela in {{ dragons_egg }}, and the spiders in {{ deepness }}. Only
really {{ eater }} succeeded in making something that did not feel human,
although other books---like {{ river }}---excuse their human aliens by arguing
that evolution forces those traits.

The Tines, specifically Flenser and Steeel, are the "street-level badguys".
They obviously pale in comparison to the Blight, but when they slaughter
Johanna and Jefri's parents and schoolmates, it feels worse than when the
Blight kills billions in the background because of how close and personal it
is.

### The Out of Band II

The main storyline follows the _Out of Band II_, or the _OOB_ as it races away
from the Blight towards the Tines' homeworld, trying to retrieve a
countermeasure that could save the galaxy from the Blight. On the ship are:

- Pham Nuwen: a human constructed by the Power "Old One" to serve as his
  presence in the Beyond, and who now suffers moments of insight even though
  Old One was destroyed.
- Ravna Bergsndot: a human librarian and applied theologist.
- Blueshell and Greenstalk: Sentient aquatic plants that ride around in
  "Skrodes" that also enhances their limited short term memory.

They barely escape the attack on Relay by the Blight and begin their desperate
attempt to reach the Tineworld. On the way they attract the attention of
genocidal butterflies who blame the humans for the Blight, as well as the
blight itself. They are also betrayed by the Skroderiders, who it turns out
were created by the Blight 5 billion years prior to act as a [fifth
column][5th_column].

[5th_column]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column

One of the themes of {{ this_book }} is being in control of yourself. <!--
TODO: Control feels like the wrong word --> Pham is puppeted by a Power, and
even after the Power is destroyed the "god shatter" controls his actions some
of the time. The Skroderiders likewise are taken over by the Blight, with
Greenstalk being used to try to assassinate Pham. Similarly each Tine is a
amalgamation of multiple "individuals" each controlled by the whole, but also
controlled by the personalities that make up the whole. And even Steel and
Flensers machinations can be seen as a primitive form of control.

{{ this_book }} does such an excellent job of introducing fascinating
ideas---the zones, the Tines, the Powers---with really well written
characters where everyone feels unique, with a different personality and
motivation. It is one of my favorite books!
