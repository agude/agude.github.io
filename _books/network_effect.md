{{ this_book }} brings back the best non-Murderbot character from the GrayCris
storyline: ART, the asshole research transport first seen in {{ mb2 }}. The
power fantasy is toned down a bit---ART isn't all-powerful anymore; it's been
taken over and needs help, so it kidnaps Murderbot to come bail it out.

The book goes deeper into Murderbot's personality and feelings. It doesn't
like logos because it's been branded. It hates pretending to be a SecUnit
because it reminds it of being enslaved. It likes being cared for. It doesn't
like being used. ART is its friend. We also see more of the horrors of the
Corporation Rim, where colonies and their people are left to die if they're
not profitable.

Agency is a major theme of {{ this_book }}. Murderbot and other SecUnits are
controlled by their governor modules. The Corporation Rim employees are
essentially owned by their employers. ART is hijacked by a virus, and the
people of the colony are mind-controlled by an alien remnant. Even the
decision by ART and the humans to risk everything to save Murderbot raises
questions about how loyalty and love can be controlling.

{{ this_book }} introduces some new characters. Murderbot 2.0 is a copy of
Murderbot's mind used as a virus, a trick it learned in {{ mb4 }}. The book
lightly explores whether the copy is still Murderbot, a question that shows up
in other sci-fi like {{ pandora }} and {{ bobiverse_one }}. {{ this_book }}
reaches roughly the same conclusion as {{ empire }}: the copy isn't really
you, because your nervous system is part of who you are, and that is not
duplicated.

It made me think about what makes a person in {{ this_series }} a _person_.
The humans are, of course. Murderbot is as well, and it has a brain augmented
with computers. ART is clearly sentient, and it only runs on computers.
Murderbot 2.0 is as well, but it is even more abstract. It's code that lives
within other systems. It made me think about how we define personhood, in the
same way that {{ wattss }} {{ blindsight }} and {{ echopraxia }} did, and
whether any of the computer systems like LLMs today meet the definition.

Another new character is SecUnit 3. It is a SecUnit that Murderbot convinces
to help out by sharing memories. Three acts as a mirror for Murderbot, letting
it see how it behaved and felt right after it first gained freedom.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of some other works:

- The `HelpMe.file` used to tell a parallel story reminds me of how {{
  brunners }} builds his world through in-universe media in {{ zanzibar }}.

- The alien-infected humans fighting a war amongst themselves while taking
  human hostages was similar to {{ clements }} {{ close_to_critical }} and {{
  forwards }} {{ dragons_egg }}.

- The alien virus taking over people's minds was like the Blight from {{
  vinges }} {{ fire_deep }}.

- Murderbot's greatest fear---being abandoned on a planet---reminded me of {{
  soldier_movie }}, which also explores the theme of a former weapon
  developing emotions and finding community.

- Murderbot and later Three sneaking into the space station and colony
  reminded me of Djan Seriy Anaplian infiltrating the Shellworld at the end of
  {{ bankss }} {{ matter }}.

This book lives up to the rest of the series, with a great mix of emotion,
action, and worldbuilding. I can't wait to read {{ mb6 }}.
