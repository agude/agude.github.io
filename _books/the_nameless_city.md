{{ this_book }} reminded me of {{ botns }}. {{ the_author }} used a blend of
real historical elements with fictional ones to build a convincing world, just
as {{ wolfe }} does with his archaic English and real-world locations.

When I reviewed {{ matter }}, I noted that its Nameless City was likely
inspired by {{ this_book }}. The similarities are:

- Both cities lie buried underground and survived a "deluge"---{{ this_city }}
  being literally [antediluvian][antediluvian_wiki], while {{ that_city }} was
  unearthed beneath the Hyeng-zhar waterfall.

- Both contain ancient sarcophagi housing primeval evils that lingers across
  uncountable eons.

- Both stories emphasize humanity's insignificance when confronted with these
  ancient civilizations.

This was an interesting short story, even though horror is not one of my
favorite genres. Given {{ the_authors }} massive influence on speculative
fiction of all genres, I plan to read more stories from the {{ series }} to
better understand his impact on the field.
