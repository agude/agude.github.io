The second book in Hamilton's Void Trilogy, <span class="book-title">The
Temporal Void</span> does a good job of continuing to build tension.

At the climax of {% include book_link.html title="The Dreaming Void" %},
Edeard earned his nickname of "Waterwalker" when he unlocked his true psychic
ability. In this book we follow his attempts to clean up his city using his
new powers. These stories are fun, but very very long. Some around 200 pages.

Halfway through these gigantic chapters, I was generally anxious to get back
to the action outside the Void. Still, the chapters always end on a high note
because the Edeard tale is the ultimate wish fulfillment: the good guy
triumphs every time. This is in fact the point, and why there is a religion
outside the Void based on Edeard's life.

Hamilton does a clever trick as well: since the Commonwealth chapters take
place in Edeard's future, the characters will foreshadow events in Edeard's
life that you'll read about later. More cleverly, Hamilton does this a few
times in good faith, and then uses it to distract you so that the climax of
Edeard's story is a surprise.

The action outside the Void continues at frantic pace, but of course not all
the sub-plots are equally exciting, so sometimes you'd finish up 200 pages of
Edeard's life to find yourself on a sub-plot that doesn't grab your attention.

Overall enjoyable, and the climax with Edeard is powerful, but the long, long
chapters cause the story to drag a little.
