<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the third novel in the {{
page.series }} series by {{ page.book_authors }}. It tells the story of a man
called Cheradenine Zakalwe, who works for the Culture's Special Circumstances
division.

The narrative structure is cleverly done. The main story is told in the
_numbered chapters_, which cover the man's most recent mission and proceed
chronologically. Interspersed are the _Roman numeral chapters_, which detail
the operative's backstory in reverse order, starting with an earlier mission
and going further back in time with each chapter. There is also a prologue and
epilogue focused on another mission that takes place after the main events,
though the reader doesn't realize this until the epilogue.

This mirrored structure works well, as events in the past often parallel those
in neighboring future chapters. Placing one storyline in reverse order also
allows {{ banks }} to save the major reveals at the beginning and end of the
man's story for the end of the book. If the story was entirely chronological,
one of the mysteries would be revealed on the first page.

I did not quite predict the twists. I guessed the chair twist, although I was
thrown off by red herrings. The identity twist---that the operative is not
really Zakalwe---I realized just a page or two before it was revealed. {{
banks }} foreshadowed this by never using the authorial voice to name the man,
only referring to him with pronouns or as "the man".

The title, {{ this_book }}, alludes to both the wet-work Zakalwe does and how
everything---a man, a sister, a chair, a ship---can become a weapon when used
as one.

I really enjoyed the book and couldn't put it down, as I wanted to understand
the man's backstory and motivations. I liked it a bit more than {{
player_of_games }}, though both are fantastic. Next up for me is {{
state_of_the_art }}, {{ banks }}'s collection of Culture short stories.
