<span class="book-title">Use of Weapons</span> is the third novel in the
Culture series by Iain M. Banks. It tells the story of a man known as
Cheradenine Zakalwe, who works for the Culture's Special Circumstances
division.

The structure of the story is clever. There is the main story, the _numbered
chapters_, which covers the most recent mission by the man as he works for the
culture. These chapters proceed in order as you would expect. There is the
operative's backstory told in the _roman numeral chapters_, which start with
his previous mission and are in reverse order, going further back in time to
with each one one. And there is a prologue and epilogue which cover another
mission that takes place after the main story, but the reader can't figure
that out until they read the epilogue half.

The narrative structure is cleverly done. The main story is told in the
_numbered chapters_, which cover the man's most recent mission and proceed
chronologically. Interspersed are the _Roman numeral chapters_, which detail
the operative's backstory in reverse order, starting with an earlier mission
and going further back in time with each chapter. There is also a prologue and
epilogue focused on another mission that takes place after the main events,
though the reader doesn't realize this until the epilogue.

This mirrored structure works well, as events in the past often parallel those
in neighboring future chapters. Placing one storyline in reverse order also
allows Banks to save the major reveals at the beginning and end of the man's
story for the end of the book. If the story was entirely chronological, one of
the mysteries would be revealed on the first page.

I did not quite predict the twists. I guessed the chair twist, although I was
thrown off by red herrings. The identity twist---that the operative is not
really Zakalwe---I realized just a page or two before it was revealed. Banks
foreshadowed this by never using the authorial voice to name the man, only
referring to him with pronouns or as "the man".

The title, <span class="book-title">Use of Weapons</span>, cleverly alludes to
both the wet-work Zakalwe does and how everything---a man, a sister, a chair,
a ship---can become a weapon when used as one.
