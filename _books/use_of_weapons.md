<span class="book-title">Use of Weapons</span> is the third novel in the
Culture series by Iain M. Banks. It is the story told in two of a man called
Cheradenine Zakalwe as he works for the Culture's Special Circumstances
division.

The structure of the story is clever. There is the main story, the _numbered
chapters_, which covers the most recent mission by the man as he works for the
culture. These chapters proceed in order as you would expect. There is the
operative's backstory told in the _roman numeral chapters_, which start with
his previous mission and are in reverse order, going further back in time to
with each one one. And there is a prologue and epilogue which cover another
mission that takes place after the main story, but the reader can't figure
that out until they read the epilogue half.

This works really well because the narrative is slightly mirrored. Events that
happen in the past are mirrored in the neighboring future chapters. And the
man's story both starts with and ends with surprise reveals, and so the only
way to have them both at the end of the book was to tell one of the stories
backwards.

I wish I could say I saw the twists coming. I sort of predicted the Chair
twist, although I was also thrown off by some of Banks's red herrings. I
realized the identity twist---that the man is not Zakalwe---only a page or two
before it was revealed. That too was foreshadowed, as Banks never used the
author's voice to give the man a name, simply using pronouns or describing him
as "the man".

I also appreciated how the title, <span class="book-title">Use of
Weapons</span>, hints at both the wet-work the operative does, and the fact
that everything---a man, a sister, a chair, a spacecraft---is a weapon if used
as one.
