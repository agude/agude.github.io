{{ this_book }} is a departs from the earlier books in the series by placing
Tintin in a real historical event: [the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria][invasion]. The book follows history closely, with Tintin witnessing
Japanese agents blowing up a rail line in a false-flag attack, just like what
happened in the real war. The tone is more serious to fit the wartime setting:
no bouncing on fat men like in {{ tt4 }}, though there's still plenty of
slapstick with Thomson and Thompson.

[invasion]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria

The artwork is strong as always, with large panels showing detailed views of
Shanghai. The story has a strong sense of place: first the crowded streets,
then the poorer countryside, and finally an occupied city. The military
hardware---planes, trains, and ships---feels heavy and menacing on the page.
Unlike {{ tt2 }}, {{ the_author }} depicts the Chinese characters with
sensitivity, even poking fun at some European stereotypes of East Asians,
while clearly condemning the Japanese occupation.

This book is more story-driven than early entries like {{ tt2 }} and {{ tt3
}}, but it's not as tightly scripted as later works like {{ tt11 }}, {{ tt12
}}, {{ tt16 }}, or {{ tt17 }}. In some ways it suffers from sticking too
closely to history: Tintin's role feels smaller against the backdrop of the
invasion.

We haven't picked our next book yet, but I suspect it will be {{ tt11 }}.
We'll see!
