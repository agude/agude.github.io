{{ this_book }} is a departure from the others in the series so far in that it
inserts Tintin into an ongoing historical event: [the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria][invasion]. The book follows history pretty closely, with Tintin
observing Japanese partisans blowing up a rail-line as a false flag operation,
just like the actual war. The comic is more serious as befits the war-time
topic: there is no bouncing on fat men like in {{ tt4 }}, but there is a lot
of slapstick with Thomson and Thompson.

The artwork is great as per usual, with some large panels offering detailed
drawings of Shanghai. It gives the story a great sense of places, first with
the crowded streets, then the sparser and poorer countryside, and finally an
occupied city. The military hardware---the planes, trains, and ships---are
render with a real weight and menace.

Unlike {{ tt2 }}, {{ the_author }} treats the Chinese characters with
sensitivity, even poking fun at some European sterotypes of East Asians and
taking a negative view of the Japanese occupation.

The book is more story-driven then some of the earlier books like {{ tt2 }}
and {{ tt3 }}, but it's not as tightly scripted as later works like {{ tt11
}}, {{ tt12 }}, {{ tt16 }}, or {{ tt17 }}. I think it suffers a bit from
following history, Tintin's role feels smaller against the backdrop of the
invasion.

We have yet to pick our next book, but I suspect it will be {{ tt11 }}. We'll
see!
