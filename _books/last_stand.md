{{ this_book }} returns to the format used in {{ bolo10 }} and {{ bolo11 }},
where multiple authors each contribute one or two short stories, instead of a
few authors writing long novellas as in {{ bolo12 }}, {{ bolo14 }}, and {{
bolo15 }}. I prefer the short story format because it allows for a wider range
of ideas and tones, but it does have a downside: there will always be some
stories I just don't like. That's what happened here.

{{ author_weber }} delivers two excellent stories, and {{ author_stirling }}
wraps up his {{ lost_legion }} storyline perfectly. But several of the new
authors stumble, either taking too many liberties with the setting or just
failing to make their stories come together.

I suspect the editor proposed a few shared themes to make the stories feel
more connected to the universe, especially since this anthology includes so
many new writers. {{ hold_until_relieved }} and {{ in_the_flesh }} both take
place in the far, far future and have Bolo minds being placed in new bodies.
{{ the_traitor }}, {{ memories_of_erin }}, and {{ a_question_of_valor }} all
deal with Bolos going rogue. And {{ memories_of_erin }}, {{ and_dont_come_back
}}, and {{ a_time_to_kill }} are set during the Final War.

Overall, I didn't enjoy this book as much as some of the earlier anthologies.
Part of that might just be fatigue; I've been reading a lot of Bolo stories in
a short time. I'm going to take a break before diving into {{ bolo14 }}, maybe
catch up on {{ mb }} with {{ mb6 }} and {{ mb7 }}, and definitely re-read {{
moon }}.

### {% short_story_title "The Sixth Sun" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_stirling }}</div>
{% rating_stars 4 %}

This story wraps up the arc started in {{ lost_legion }} and {{
ancestral_voices }}. The main characters are the children and grandchildren of
the soldiers from those earlier stories, and their enemies are the remnants of
the Aztec Empire from {{ ancestral_voices }}. It's mostly a story about
people, but at the end the Bolo saves the day in a very satisfying manner.

It's interesting how these stories manage to feel bright and even hopeful,
while actually being some of the darker Bolo tales. In this one, the Aztecs
are constantly cutting out hearts and slaughtering hundreds of their own
slaves to prevent revolt during the attack. There are also nods to the
American fiefdoms with their constant atrocities from {{ trolls }} and {{
bolo3 }}. The inclusion of the dark content makes the village itself seem more
idyllic by contrast: a small remnant of civilization that has managed to
endure.

### {% short_story_title "The Traitor" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_weber }}</div>
{% rating_stars 5 %}

The Bolo LNC Lance appears to have gone rogue, and it's up to Bolo ART Arthur
to hunt him down. {{ author_weber_lastname }} is great at writing Bolo combat
scenes, and this story is no exception. It is packed with detail about how
Bolos fight and the technology they use. It's similar to {{ field_test }} in
its exploration of the fear of Bolos turning rogue, with a reveal that Lance
actually has a motive: saving a group of children. Other stories that explore
similar ideas include {{ rogue_bolo }}, {{ the_legacy_of_leonidas }}, {{
little_red_hen }}, and {{ author_weber_lastname_possessive }} own {{
miles_to_go }}.

### {% short_story_title "Yesterday's Gods" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_mina }} and {{ author_forstchen }}</div>
{% rating_stars 3 %}

I really enjoyed {{ author_forstchen_lastname_possessive }} {{ endings }},
which invented the Last War, explored the cost of vengeance, _and_ delivered
some awesome Bolo combat. But I didn't like this one. The plot is fine: a
bomber pilot is shot down, tries to survive, and encounters the descendants of
humans on a bug-infested planet. The concept of the survivors using religion
to pass down knowledge about their Bolo could have been fascinating, like {{
foundation }} or {{ leibowitz }}. But the story leans too much into the
juvenile and salacious, with the main character obsessing over sex, and how
attractive all the women are, which distracts from the story.

### {% short_story_title "Memories of Erin" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_greenberger }}</div>
{% rating_stars 2 %}

This one doesn't really feel like a Bolo story. That isn't necessarily a bad
thing; the idea of a Bolo and its commander struggling but ultimately failing
to achieve their goal is new, and it's an interesting idea. But the problem is
that this story takes too many liberties with the setting. It invents a new
Galactic Empire to replace the Concordiat, and it makes the universe feel
smaller by tying almost everything back to Earth and the Solar System. It also
adds new "facts" about Bolos that don't make sense, like their computer core
being over a dozen stories tall (how does that fit inside a Bolo?), that they
can travel at {% units number="800" unit="kph" %}, or that they have a secret
radio channel the humans don't know about for private conversations.

The story follows Erin as she tries to stop the virus that's corrupted her
Bolo, similar to {{ murphosensor }}. It alternates between flashbacks about
her life and the battle that led to the infection as she faces her impending
death. But {{ author_greenberger }} doesn't make Erin compelling enough for
her death to have real weight.

### {% short_story_title "Hold Until Relieved" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_keith }}</div>
{% rating_stars 4 %}

Four billion years in the future, a Bolo is excavated by cyborg aliens and
relives the moments before its "death" in the failed defense of the imperial
palace near Geneva, Switzerland. This is the second story to mention an
"Empire" after {{ memories_of_erin }}, so maybe the editor and authors agreed
on a general shared timeline for the universe. The story introduces "Cybolos",
human minds fused with machines, a theme we'll see more in {{ a_time_to_kill
}}. The Bolo's mind is finally transferred into a new, alien form, which ties
in with {{ in_the_flesh }}.

This one is a little like {{ combat_unit }}, with a Bolo waking up while being
probed by aliens it assumes are hostile. Digging up the Bolo because it was a
large magnetic anomaly reminds me of the excavation of Tycho Magnetic Anomaly
One---the monolith---in {{ odyssey }}.

### {% short_story_title "A Question of Valor" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_johnson }}</div>
{% rating_stars 3 %}

I love the concept of this story. A Bolo is ordered to "defend my people" and
realizes that, even if they win the war, the mining colony will still be
economically devastated, unable to grow or import enough food, and eventually
destroyed by earthquakes. So it flees, triggering an investigation into its
supposed cowardice and a large settlement payout from GM that ends up saving
the colony. But the writing's a little rough, and it doesn't feel like there
are enough clues for the reader to solve the mystery along with the detective.

There are a couple of fun easter eggs: a character has a mustache like Hercule
Poirot's from {{ christies }} {{ poirot }}, and an aircar's call sign mixes {{
thx }} and {{ nineteen_eighty_four }}. This story is also a bit like {{
rogue_bolo }}, where the Bolo deliberately bends its orders to better fulfill
its mission, and like {{ last_command }}, where the Bolo causes earthquakes
while operating underground.

### {% short_story_title "In the Flesh" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_perry }} and {{ author_decamp }}</div>
{% rating_stars 3 %}

A Bolo's mind is resurrected and placed in a human body by energy beings in
the far future, who need help fighting off invading insect-like aliens. As a
human, the Bolo realizes it loved its former commander. It dies willingly on a
suicide mission to protect the aliens, who it believes can create a new, more
just universe.

The human--Bolo relationship is similar to {{ little_red_hen }} and {{
miles_to_go }} from {{ bolo12 }}.

### {% short_story_title "And Don't Come Back" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_thies }}</div>
{% rating_stars 5 %}

The Bolo DLS Dallas detects and hacks an armada full of slave soldiers before
they can cross the Concordiat border. It conspires with one of the slaves to
turn the ships around and send them back to attack their masters. At the same
time, Dallas has a pleasant chat with some children on a beach. A simple
story, but it adds Kloude Chambers as new Bolo tech for subspace manipulation,
shows a bit of normal life in the Concordiat, and ends with a satisfying "the
bad guys messed with the wrong people" revenge plot.

### {% short_story_title "A Time to Kill" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_weber }}</div>
{% rating_stars 5 %}

The Mk. XXXIII Bolo Shiva is destroyed as it finishes Operation Ragnarok: a
genocidal campaign against the Melconians during the Final War. Years later,
human refugees settle on the planet, only to have a fleet of Melconian
refugees arrive in orbit, their ships too battered to go on. Both groups
decide the only option is to annihilate the other, but when Shiva wakes up and
is commanded to take part, it realizes it's already done too much killing.
This story is similar to {{ endings }}, but with a twist: here, the Melconians
land on a human world.

{{ author_weber }} is the undisputed master of Bolo stories. All three of his,
{{ miles_to_go }}, {{ the_traitor }}, and this one, are fantastic. He really
understands that a good Bolo story centers on the Bolos themselves and the
moral and philosophical dilemmas they raise, while adding enough cool tech and
battle scenes to sugarcoat it. It makes me excited to read his short story {{
dfs }} in the Bolo-inspired {{ world_breakers }}, and even his {{ honorverse
}} series, starting with {{ honor }}.

### {% short_story_title "A Brief History of Human Expansion Beyond Concordiat Space" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_evans }}</div>
{% rating_stars 5 %}

An in-universe technical paper, similar to {{ technical_history }}, but about
the various alien races. It includes a tongue-firmly-in-cheek paragraph about
the "challenge scholars face in gathering, reconciling, and validating
information from existing and often contradictory sources", a clever way to
explain how the different authors have inconsistent descriptions of Bolos. It
also waves away the "abandoned Bolo is destroyed by the Concordiat" storyline
we see in {{ a_relic_of_war }} and {{ little_dog_gone }} as either apocryphal
or the result of an overly cautious policy.
