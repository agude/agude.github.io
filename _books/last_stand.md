### {% short_story_title "The Sixth Sun" %}

This story is the final part of the story started in {{ lost_legion }} and {{
ancestral_voices }}. The main characters are the children and grandchildren of
the soldiers from the first two, and their enemy is the remnants of the Aztec
Empire from {{ ancestral_voices }}. It's mostly a story about people, but at
the end the Bolo comes in and saves the day in a most satisfying manner.

It's interesting that these stories feel bright and most hopefully while
actually being some of the darker Bolo stories. In this one, the Aztecs are
constantly cutting people's hearts out, and murder hundreds of their slaves so
they won't be able to revolt during the attack. There are also some references
to the American fiefdoms from {{ trolls }} and {{ bolo3 }}.

### {% short_story_title "The Traitor" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_weber }}</div>
{% rating_stars 5 %}

The Bolo LNC Lance has seemingly gone rogue, and it's up to ART Arthur to hunt
him down. {{ author_weber_lastname }} is very good at writing Bolo combat
scenes and this is no exception, with great details about how they fight and
the technology they use. It is similar to {{ field_test }} in its focus on the
fear of Bolos going rogue, and the revelation that it actually has a
motive---in this case getting a group of children to safety. Other stories
with similar ideas are {{ rogue_bolo }}, {{ the_legacy_of_leonidas }}, {{
little_red_hen }}, and {{ author_weber_lastname_possessive }} own {{
miles_to_go }}.

### {% short_story_title "Yesterday's Gods" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_mina }} and {{ author_forstchen }}</div>
{% rating_stars 3 %}

I really enjoyed {{ author_forstchen_lastname_possessive }} {{ endings }},
which invented the Last War, explored the cost of vengeance, **and** had some
awesome Bolo combat. This story I didn't like as much. The plot is fine: a
bomber pilot is shot down, tries to survive, and runs into the ancestors of
humans on a bug-infested planet. And the idea that the survivors having been
using religion to pass down knowledge about their Bolo could have been really
interesting, similar to {{ foundation }} and {{ leibowitz }}. But there is an
puerile and salacious aspect that drags it down, for example with the main
character lamenting not being able to have sex anymore because he is marooned
on the planet, and then later with the fixation on how hot the multiple women
he marries are.

### {% short_story_title "Memories of Erin" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_greenberger }}</div>
{% rating_stars 2 %}

This doesn't feel like a Bolo story. That's good in that it is unique in that
the Bolo and their commander struggle but fail to achieve their goal. That's
new, that's an interesting idea! The bad part is the story takes too much
liberty with the setting. It invents a new Galactic Empire to replace the
Concordiat. It makes the universe feel small by tying almost everything back
to Earth and the Solar system. And then it make up new facts about Bolos that
don't make sense, like their computer core is more than a dozen stories tall
(How does that fit inside the Bolo!?), that they can travel at {% units
number="800" unit="kph" %}, or that Bolos have a back-channel radio they set
up to chat without humans knowing.

The story follows Erin as she tries to stop the virus that has corrupted her
Bolo, similar to {{ murphosensor }}. It consists of flashbacks about her life
and the battle that led up to the infection, as she contemplates her impending
death. But {{ author_greenberger }} did not make me care enough for Erin to
make her death meaningful.
