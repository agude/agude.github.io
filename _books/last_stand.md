This story wraps up the arc started in {{ lost_legion }} and {{
ancestral_voices }}. The main characters are the children and grandchildren of
the soldiers from those earlier stories, and their enemies are the remnants of
the Aztec Empire from {{ ancestral_voices }}. It's mostly a story about
people, but at the end the Bolo saves the day in a very satisfying manner.

It's interesting how these stories manage to feel bright and even hopeful,
while actually being some of the darker Bolo tales. In this one, the Aztecs
are constantly cutting out hearts and slaughtering hundreds of their own
slaves to prevent revolt during the attack. There are also nods to the
American fiefdoms with their constant atrocities from {{ trolls }} and {{
bolo3 }}. The inclusion of the dark content makes the village itself seem
more idyllic by contrast; a small remnant of civilization that has managed to
endure.

The Bolo LNC Lance appears to have gone rogue, and it's up to Bolo ART Arthur
to hunt him down. {{ author_weber_lastname }} is great at writing Bolo combat
scenes, and this story is no exception. It is packed with detail about how
Bolos fight and the technology they use. It's similar to {{ field_test }} in
its exploration of the fear of Bolos turning rogue, with a reveal that Lance
actually has a motive: saving a group of children. Other stories that explore
similar ideas include {{ rogue_bolo }}, {{ the_legacy_of_leonidas }}, {{
little_red_hen }}, and {{ author_weber_lastname_possessive }} own {{
miles_to_go }}.

### {% short_story_title "Yesterday's Gods" %}

I really enjoyed {{ author_forstchen_lastname_possessive }} {{ endings }},
which invented the Last War, explored the cost of vengeance, **and** had some
awesome Bolo combat. This story I didn't like as much. The plot is fine: a
bomber pilot is shot down, tries to survive, and runs into the ancestors of
humans on a bug-infested planet. And the idea that the survivors having been
using religion to pass down knowledge about their Bolo could have been really
interesting, similar to {{ foundation }} and {{ leibowitz }}. But there is an
puerile and salacious aspect that drags it down, for example with the main
character lamenting not being able to have sex anymore because he is marooned
on the planet, and then later with the fixation on how hot the multiple women
he marries are.

I really liked {{ author_forstchen_lastname_possessive }} {{ endings }}, which
invented the Last War, explored the cost of vengeance, **and** delivered some
awesome Bolo combat. This one didn't land as well for me. The plot is fine: a
bomber pilot is shot down, tries to survive, and encounters the descendants of
humans on a bug-infested planet. The concept of the survivors using religion
to pass down knowledge about their Bolo could have been fascinating, like {{
foundation }} or {{ leibowitz }}. But the story leans too much into the
juvenile and salacious, with the main character obsessing over sex, and how
attractive all the women are, which undercuts the more interesting ideas.

### {% short_story_title "Memories of Erin" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_greenberger }}</div>
{% rating_stars 2 %}

This one doesn't really feel like a Bolo story. That's not all bad---it's unique
in that the Bolo and its commander struggle but ultimately fail to achieve
their goal. That's new, and it's an interesting idea. The problem is that it
takes too many liberties with the setting. It invents a new Galactic Empire to
replace the Concordiat, and it makes the universe feel smaller by tying almost
everything back to Earth and the Solar System. It also adds new "facts" about
Bolos that don't make sense, like their computer core being over a dozen
stories tall (how does that fit inside a Bolo?), that they can travel at {%
units number="800" unit="kph" %}, or that they have a secret radio channel
the humans don't know about for private conversations.

The story follows Erin as she tries to stop the virus that's corrupted her
Bolo, similar to {{ murphosensor }}. It alternates between flashbacks about
her life and the battle that led to the infection as she faces her impending
death. But {{ author_greenberger }} doesn't make Erin compelling enough for
her death to have real emotional weight.
