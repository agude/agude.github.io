When I watch a movie, I always want to peek around the frame. Not to see what
the cast and crew are doing on set, but to see more of the world and figure
out how it got to be the way it is. That's what drew me to {{ this_book
}}---the opportunity to explore the world just before the apocalypse and
understand how it reached this point.

The primary plot is a straightforward whodunit. A man is found hanged in a
McDonald's, and only Detective Palace believes it's murder; suicides,
especially by hanging, are common in Concord now that the world is ending. A
secondary plot follows Palace's younger sister, Nico, whose husband has gone
missing.

My favorite parts of {{ this_book }} are the flashbacks and glimpses of the
outside world: the day the asteroid was first announced, the
news conference when the impact probability hit 100%, the brewing war with
Pakistan to prevent them from nuking the asteroid, and the refugees and runaways.
It made me think about how I would handle the end of the world. The book is similar
to {{ gun }}, in that the world is the main attraction and the detective story
is secondary. And like {{ gun }}, {{ this_book }} doesn't quite give me enough
of the world.

The mystery itself was fine. I was misled by several red herrings, so much so
that at one point I thought the main mystery was solved and the rest of the
story would focus on the Nico plot. In the end, the Nico plot drags the book
down: we discover she's a calculating psychopath who married her husband to
send him to his death in search of the government's secret plan to save the
world. This revelation comes out of nowhere and is clearly setting up the
thread that ties all three novels together. I hope it's another red herring
though, because the hopelessness of the book is so compelling that I would
hate to have it rendered pointless.

{{ this_book }} is a fast and fun read, and I look forward to seeing how the
world changes as the asteroid gets closer in {{ lpm2 }}.
