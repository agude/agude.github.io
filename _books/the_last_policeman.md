I'm the kind of person who, when I watch a movie, wants to peek around the
frame. Not to see what the cast and crew are doing on the set, but to see more
of the world and figure out how it got the way it is. {{ this_book }} offers
that. This book takes place just before the apocalypse, the world and
civilization is falling apart, and it lets us explore how it got to be that
way.

The primary plot is a simple whodunit murder. A man is found hanged in a
McDonald's and only detective Palace believe it is a murder; suicides,
especially by hanging, are common in Concord, New Hampshire now that the world
is ending. The secondary plot follows Nico, Palace's younger sister, whose
husband has gone missing.

My favorite parts of {{ this_book }} is the flashbacks and snippets of the
outsides world we get to see: the day the asteroid was first announced, the
news conference when the impact probability hit 100%, the brewing war with
Pakistan to prevent them from nuking the asteroid, the refugees and runaways.
It made me think about how I would handle the end of the world. It's similar
to {{ gun }}, the last book I read, in that the world is the main attraction.
And like {{ gun }}, {{ this_book }} does not quite give me another about the
world.

The mystery itself was fine, and I was misled by several of the red herrings,
so much so that at one point I thought the main mystery was over and the rest
of the story would focus on the secondary Nico plot. In the end, the Nico plot
drags down the book: we discover she's calculating psychopath who marries her
husband only to send him to die in order to find out more about the
government's secret plan to save to world. It comes out of nowhere and is
clearly setting up the underlying thread that ties all three novels together.
I hope its another red herring, the hopelessness of the book is so compelling,
I would hate to have it rendered pointless.

Next up is {{ lpm2 }}.
