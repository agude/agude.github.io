<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> by <span

novel. It is set in Concord, New Hampshire, and follows Detective Palace as he
tries to solve a murder six months before a K-T impact level asteroid wipes
out civilization.

I'm the kind of person who, when I watch a movie, wants to peek around the
frame. Not to see what the cast and crew are doing on the set, but to see more
of the world and figure out how it got the way it is. That was what drew me to
{{ this_book }}, the opportunity to explore the world just before the
apocalypse, and to understand how it got to be the way it is.

The primary plot is a simple whodunit. A man is found hanged in a McDonald's
and only detective Palace believe it is a murder; suicides, especially by
hanging, are common in Concord now that the world is ending. The secondary
plot follows Palace's younger sister, Nico, whose husband has gone missing.

My favorite parts of {{ this_book }} is the flashbacks and snippets of the
outsides world we get to see: the day the asteroid was first announced, the
news conference when the impact probability hit 100%, the brewing war with
Pakistan to prevent them from nuking the asteroid, the refugees and runaways.
It made me think about how I would handle the end of the world. It's similar
to {{ gun }}, the last book I read, in that the world is the main attraction,
the detective story is secondary. And like {{ gun }}, {{ this_book }} does not
quite give me enough of the world.

The mystery itself was fine. I was misled by several of the red herrings, so
much so that at one point I thought the main mystery was solved and the rest
of the story would focus on the Nico plot. In the end, the Nico plot drags the
book down: we discover she's a calculating psychopath who married her husband
in order to send him to die to find out about the government's secret plan to
save to world. It comes out of nowhere and is clearly setting up the thread
that ties all three novels together. I hope it's another red herring, because
the hopelessness of the book is so compelling, I would hate to have it
rendered pointless.

{{ this_book }} is a fast and fun read, and I look forward to seeing how the
world changes as the asteroid gets closer in {{ lpm2 }}.
