<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in Pater
Watts's Firefall series, although it takes place at roughly the same time as
{% include book_link.html title="Blindsight" %}. It fallows parasitologist
Daniel Brüks as he gets dragged into a conflict between multiple trans-human
factions.

The world Watts build in {{ blindsight }} was captivating, and the scientific
and philosophical arguments about consciousness were fascinating. I **loved**
it. {{ this_book }} expands on the exceptional worldbuild of its predecessor
while focusing on the ideas of god, godhood, freewill, and the place of humans
in a trans-human world. It is a fantastic sequel, possibly even better than
the first.

The Major characters are:

- Daniel Brüks, a parasitologist and baseline human who has decided against
  getting absolutely any enhancements.

- Jim Keaton, Siri Keaton's father and human solider.

- The Bicamerals, a hivemind composed of people who have edited their brains
and who discover scientific advancements through apparently religious means.
Their interpreter is a slightly modified human, Lianna Lutterodt.

- Valerie, a vampire escaped from an academic lab on a mission to free her
  people. Along for the ride are four zombie soldiers.

- Portia, an alien computer--slime-mold sent by _Rorschach_ to Icarus.

The novel is full of Christian imagery, to augment its theme of
transcendentalism and digital theology:

- Valerie is a Moses figure: she is trying to free her people from slavery,
  she first appears in the desert under a pillar of flame (the Bicamerals's
  tornado seen through night-vision goggles).

- Vampires have a "crucifix glitch" used to keep them controlled.

- The ship used by the Bicamerals is the Crown of Thorns. _Rorschach_ from {{
  blindsight }} is in the shape of a crown of thorns.

- Heaven "exists", as a virtual reality world people retreat to.

Parasites and biology also is a central theme. Brüks studies parasites, but in
someways he is one as the weakest member of the group and one forced to hide
for his own safety. Humans too are like a parasites, trying to survive among
much more powerful trans-humans. And Portia, the alien smart matter sent by
_Rorschach_ to Icarus, traps and studies the other characters in the book just
like Brüks does to the animals he studies in Oregon.
