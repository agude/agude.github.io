<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in Pater
Watts's Firefall series, although it takes place at roughly the same time as
{% include book_link.html title="Blindsight" %}. It fallows parasitologist
Daniel Brüks as he gets dragged into a conflict between multiple trans-human
factions, travels to the Icarus station orbiting the sun, and back to Earth.

The world Watts build in {{ blindsight }} was enthralling, and the scientific
and philosophical arguments about consciousness were fascinating. I **loved**
it. {{ this_book }} expands on the exceptional worldbuilding of its
predecessor while focusing on the ideas of god, godhood, freewill, and the
place of humans in a trans-human world. It is a fantastic sequel, possibly
even better than the first.

The Major characters are:

- Daniel Brüks, a parasitologist and baseline human who has decided against
  getting absolutely any enhancements.

- Jim Keaton, Siri Keaton's father and human solider.

- The Bicamerals, a hivemind composed of people who have edited their brains
  and who discover scientific advancements through apparently religious means.
  Their interpreter is a slightly modified human, Lianna Lutterodt.

- Valerie, a vampire escaped from an academic lab on a mission to free her
  people. Along for the ride are her four zombie soldiers.

- Portia, an alien computer--slime-mold sent by _Rorschach_ to Icarus.

The novel is full of Christian imagery, to augment its theme of
transcendentalism and digital theology:

- Valerie is a Moses figure: she is trying to free her people from slavery,
  she first appears in the desert under a pillar of flame (the Bicamerals's
  tornado seen through night-vision goggles).

- Vampires have a "crucifix glitch" used to keep them controlled.

- The ship used by the Bicamerals is the Crown of Thorns. _Rorschach_ from {{
  blindsight }} is in the shape of a crown of thorns.

- Heaven "exists", as a virtual reality world people retreat to.

- Resurrection---or at least the continuation of life after death---with the
snake Brüks samples in the desert, the Zombies, and Brüks himself after he is
infected by Portia.

Parasites and biology also is a central theme. Brüks studies parasites, but in
someways he is one as the weakest member of the group and one forced to hide
for his own safety. Humans too are like a parasites, trying to survive among
much more powerful trans-humans. And Portia, the alien smart matter sent by
_Rorschach_ to Icarus, traps and studies the other characters in the book just
like Brüks does to the animals he studies in Oregon.

{{ this_book }} received mixed reviews from others compared to the universally
rave reviews for {{ blindsight }}, primarily because people thought it was
even more confusing. While it's true that the narrator, Brüks, is the person
with the least idea of what is going on, I found the plot not too hard to
follow. All the mysteries are eventually revealed and explained if you pay
attention. So far {{ this_book }} is my favorite read of the year.
