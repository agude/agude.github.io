<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the fifth and final book
in <span class="author-name">{{ page.author }}</span>'s <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> tetralogy. It follows Severian as
he leaves Urth to save mankind and returns to witness its destruction and
rebirth.

I was impressed with how {{ wolfe }} was able to maintain the quest narrative
structure even while Severian was trapped on a spaceship for a quarter of the
book. I really enjoyed Tzadkiel's spaceship, and Severian's return to Urth as
the Conciliator. However, the trial on Yesod and some of the later sections
during the deluge feel simultaneously too philosophical and over-explain some
of the mysteries from earlier books.

For example, I had assumed the time gaps in the original four books were due
to time travel or resurrection, as in each case Severian was in danger and
then the narrative jumped forward without Severian able to remember what
happened. But in {{ this_book }} Severian wakes up next to his corpse and the
aliens explain everything, which felt heavy-handed.

The Christian allegory was also less subtle in {{ this_book }} which made the
biblical parallels and Christ-like nature of Severian's journey feel more
overt compared to the nuanced symbolic references in the original four books.

It was fun to see Urth long before Severian's time, and the starship operating
like an age of sail ship. But the book felt uneven overall. {{ citadel_autarch
}} was a stronger ending to the series in my opinion.
