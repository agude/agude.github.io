<cite class="book-title">The Urth of the New Sun</cite> is the fifth and final
book in Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun tetralogy. It follows Severian as
he leaves Urth to save mankind and returns to witness its destruction and
rebirth.

I was impressed with how Wolfe was able to maintain the quest narrative
structure even while Severian was trapped on a spaceship for a quarter of the
book. I really enjoyed Tzadkiel's spaceship, and Severian's return to Urth as
the Conciliator. However, the trial on Yesod and some of the later sections
during the deluge feel simultaneously too philosophical and over-explain some
of the mysteries from earlier books.

For example, I had thought the time gaps in the original four books were due
to time travel or resurrection, as Severian was in danger and then the
narrative jumped forward without recollection. But in {% include
book_link.html title="The Urth of the New Sun" %} Severian wakes up next to
his corpse and the aliens explain everything, which felt heavy-handed.

The Christian allegory was also less subtle in {% include book_link.html
title="The Urth of the New Sun" %} which made the biblical parallels and
Christ-like nature of Severian's journey feel more overt compared to the
nuanced symbolic references in the original four books.

It was fun to see Urth long before Severian's time, and the starship operating
like an age of sail ship. But the book felt uneven overall. {% include
book_link.html title="The Citadel of the Autarch" %} was a stronger ending to
the series in my opinion.
