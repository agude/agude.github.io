<span class="book-title">The Urth of the New Sun</span> is the fifth and final
book in Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun tetralogy. It follows Severian as
he leaves Urth to save mankind and returns to witness it's destruction and
rebirth.

I was impressed with how Wolfe was able to keep the "questing from adventure
to adventure" narrative structure even while Severian was trapped on a
spaceship for a quarter of the book. I really enjoyed Tzadkiel's spaceship,
and when Severian returned to Urth as the Conciliator. But the trial on Yesod
and some of the later book during the deluge are simultaneously too
philosophical and over-explain some of the mysteries from earlier in the book.

For example, I had thought that the time gaps in the original four books were
due to some time travel or resurrection---as Severian was in danger in some
way during each and then the narrative jumped forward without
recollection---but in Urth Severian wakes up next to is corpse and has the
aliens explain it all, which felt heavy-handed.

It was fun to see the Urth long before the time of Severian, and to see the
starship that operates more like an age of sails ship, but the book felt
uneven. I think {% include book_link.html title="The Citadel of the Autarch"
%} was the better ending to the series.
