<span class="book-title">The Player of Games</span> is the second Culture book
by Iain M. Banks. It tells the story of the master game-player Jernau Morat
Gurgeh as he is recruited to play Azad, the most complicated game in the
galaxy and the basis for the Empire of Azad's entire government.

<span class="book-title">The Player of Games</span> is set in the same
universe as {% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}, but is
otherwise unconnected, and indeed could not be more different. <span
class="book-title">The Player of Games</span> is in key ways the opposite of
{% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}: _Games_ is about one
man having an outsized impact while _Phlebas_ is about the futility of
individual action. _Games_ takes place from the point of view of the Culture
encountering a more barbaric people while _Phlebas_ views the Culture from the
"barbarian" perspective.
