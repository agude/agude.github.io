<cite class="book-title">The Player of Games</cite> is the second novel in
Iain M. Banks's Culture series. It tells the story of Jernau Morat Gurgeh, a
master game player who is recruited to play Azad, an incredibly complex game
that serves as the basis for the Empire of Azad's entire government.

<cite class="book-title">The Player of Games</cite> is set in the same
universe as {% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}, but is
otherwise unconnected. In fact, the two books could not be more different.
<cite class="book-title">The Player of Games</cite> is in key ways the
opposite of {% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}: While <cite
class="book-title">Phlebas</cite> focuses on the futility of individual
action, <cite class="book-title">Games</cite> explores how one person can have
an outsized impact. <cite class="book-title">Phlebas</cite> is told from the
perspective of a "barbarian" encountering the Culture, whereas <cite
class="book-title">Games</cite> presents the Culture's viewpoint as it
encounters a more primitive civilization.

I appreciated how Gurgeh's Azad play improved as he internalized the Empire's
culture, but it was seeing the cracks in the Empire, and finally fully
rejecting their philosophy and embracing his Culture roots that allowed him to
dominate.

[Banks's sadism][wasp], as seen in
{% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}, reappears in <cite
class="book-title">The Player of Games</cite> but in a more controlled manner.
Rather than gratuitous, it serves to shape the reader's (and Gurgeh's) view of
the Azadian Empire and pushes Gurgeh to reject their influence.

Overall a fantastic story I could hardly put down, and the Culture book I wish
I had started with.
