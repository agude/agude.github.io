<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second novel in <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>'s <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series. It tells the story of
Jernau Morat Gurgeh, a master game player who is recruited to play Azad, an
incredibly complex game that serves as the basis for the Empire of Azad's
entire government.

{{ this_book }} is set in the same universe as {{ consider_phlebas }}, but is
otherwise unconnected. In fact, the two books could not be more different. {{
this_book }} is in key ways the opposite of {{ consider_phlebas }}: While {{
short_phlebas }} focuses on the futility of individual action, {{ short_games
}} explores how one person can have an outsized impact. {{ short_phlebas }} is
told from the perspective of a "barbarian" encountering the Culture, whereas
{{ short_games }} presents the Culture's viewpoint as it encounters a more
primitive civilization.

I appreciated how Gurgeh's Azad play improved as he internalized the Empire's
culture, but it was seeing the cracks in the Empire, and finally fully
rejecting their philosophy and embracing his Culture roots that allowed him to
dominate.

[{{ bankss}} sadism][wasp], as seen in {{ consider_phlebas }}, reappears in {{
this_book }} but in a more controlled manner. Rather than gratuitous, it
serves to shape the reader's (and Gurgeh's) view of the Azadian Empire and
pushes Gurgeh to reject their influence.

Overall a fantastic story I could hardly put down, and the {{ this_series }} I
wish I had started with.
