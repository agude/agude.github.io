<span class="book-title">The Player of Games</span> is the second Culture book
by Iain M. Banks. It tells the story of the master game-player Jernau Morat
Gurgeh as he is recruited to play Azad, the most complicated game in the
galaxy and the basis for the Empire of Azad's entire government.

<span class="book-title">The Player of Games</span> is set in the same
universe as {% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}, but is
otherwise unconnected, and indeed could not be more different. <span
class="book-title">The Player of Games</span> is in key ways the opposite of
{% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}: _Games_ is about one
man having an outsized impact while _Phlebas_ is about the futility of
individual action. _Games_ is written from the Culture's point of view as it
encounters a more barbaric people, while _Phlebas_ is from the point of view
of a "barbarian" encountering the Culture.

I appreciated how Gurgeh improved his Azad playing as he internalized the
Empire's culture more, but it was seeing the cracks in the Empire, and finally
fully rejecting their philosophy and embracing his Culture roots that allowed
him to dominate.

[Banks's sadism][wasp] makes another appearance, but in a more controlled
manner than {% include book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas" %}. It doesn't
go on and on, is limited to a few pages, and serves to shape yours (and
Gurgeh's) view of the Azadian Empire and lead him to start rejecting their
influence.

Overall a fantastic story I could hardly put down, and really the Culture book
I should have started with.
