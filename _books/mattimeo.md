The previous two books, {{ redwall }} and {{ mossflower }}, followed a similar
structure: a warrior mouse embarks on a quest, finds a sword, returns, and
uses the sword to defeat an evil commander and their army threatening the
woodlanders of Mossflower. {{ this_book }} takes the series in a new
direction.

The threat isn't an evil leader and their army; it's the cunning fox Slagar,
who uses stealth and guile to kidnap the children of Redwall. Mathias and his
fellow warriors must leave the abbey to recover their children, leading them
to the lost abbey of Loamhedge and the underground kingdom of Malkariss. While
they're away, the "defenseless" abbey is occupied by birds from the North, who
soon realize the humble woodlanders are still a formidable threat.

Everything you'd expect from a {{ the_author }} {{ redwall_series }} book is
present: action, adventure, feasting, the death of beloved characters,
vengeance upon the villains, and now with two distinct plot lines. {{
this_book }} is {{ the_author }} hitting his stride.

Once again, my kids loved it. They even cried as several favorite characters
met heroic ends. On to {{ mariel }}!
