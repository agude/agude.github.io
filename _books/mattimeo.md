 The previous two books, {{ redwall }} and {{ mossflower }} had very similar
 structures: a warrior mouse goes on a quest, finds a sword, returns and uses
 the sword to defeat an evil commander and their army that threaten the
 woodlanders of Mossflower. {{ this_book }} takes the series in a new
 direction.

The threat isn't an evil leader and their army, it's a cunning
fox---Slaggar---who uses stealth and guile to kidnap the children of Redwall.
Mathias and his fellow warriors are forced to leave the abbey to recover their
children, which leads them to the lost abbey of Loamhedge and the underground
kingdom of Malkaris. While they're away the "defenseless" abbey is
occupied by birds from the North who soon realize the humble woodlanders are
still quite a threat.

Everything you expect from a {{ the_author }} {{redwall_series }} book is
here: action, adventure, feasting, the death of beloved characters, vengeance
visited upon the bad guys, and two different plot lines. {{ this_book }} is {{
the_author }} hitting his stride.

Once again my kids loved it. They even cried as several favorite characters
met heroic ends. On to {{ mariel }}!
