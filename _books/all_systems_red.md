In {{ this_book }} we're introduced to Murderbot as it protects a group of
scientists on an alien planet. They soon realize that another
group---GrayCris---is trying to kill them to cover up the fact that there are
alien ruins on the planet. Murderbot has to figure out how to save its people
and escape.

{{ this_book }} is a fun, quick read. There's a good mix of humor and action,
and Murderbot is surprisingly relatable for a... murderbot. It's depressed,
anxious, and mostly wants to binge-watch TV, but it has a (boring) job to do
first. It doesn't like being around people, is kind of horrified when they're
nice to it, but still feels compelled to protect them.

{{ this_book }} reminded me of {{ laumers }} {{ bolo_series }}.[^bolo] Both
feature intelligent weapon systems that often seem more human than the people
around them. Murderbot and the tanks of the Dinochrome Brigade share a sense
of duty to their humans---but while Bolos are hardwired for loyalty, Murderbot
chooses to care. The book also echoes {{ heinleins }} works---like {{ stranger
}} and {{ moon }}---in its depiction of group marriages and communal living.
And like {{ taylors }} {{ bob1 }}, {{ this_book }} follows an AI that breaks
free from its programming to gain freedom.

[^bolo]: {{ bolo1 }}, {{ bolo2 }}, etc.

I finished the book in a day and jumped right into {{ mb2 }}.
