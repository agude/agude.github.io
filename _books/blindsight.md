<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a hard sci-fi novel about
first contact with aliens in the near future. A crew of four transhumans and a
vampire are sent on a spaceship to investigate an anomaly in the solar system
after a swarm of alien probes scan Earth.

The main theme is consciousness and what it means to be human. The characters
on the spaceship _Theseus_ have been altered mentally:

- Siri Keeton had half his brain removed, losing empathy and emotion. He tries
  to emulate them by following learned rules.
- Amanda Bates's brain is connected to an army of robot soldiers.
- Susan James has three added personalities in her mind.
- Isaac Szpindel replaced so much of his body with tech that his mind can live
  outside it in the ship itself.
- Jukka Sarasti---a resurrected vampire---is far smarter and faster than a
  human but likely not conscious.

They approach the alien ship _Rorschach_. Although it seems to communicate in
English, they realize it just pattern-matches and does not understand
language. They board _Rorschach_, capturing aliens called
Scramblers---extremely intelligent but, like _Rorschach_ and Sarasti, not
conscious. The Scramblers escape, and the crew realizes _Rorschach_ planted
them intentionally to be captured. _Rorschach_ has been manipulating them from
the start.

The book argues consciousness may have accidentally evolved in humans and now
hinders us. The less conscious characters are more capable---James, with four
minds, is taken over by Rorschach and forced to mutiny, while Siri with half a
brain sees patterns others miss. _Rorschach_, the Scramblers, and Sarasti lack
consciousness completely, allowing them to react faster, think deeper, and
plan farther ahead.

The worldbuilding is fantastic and haunting. The mysteries are compelling and
their answers are satisfying. The characters feel alive, even the vampire.
<cite class="book-title">Blindsight</cite> is not hopeful but is one of the
best sci-fi books I've read.
