<span class="book-title">Blindsight</span> is a hard sci-fi novel about
first contact with aliens in the near future. Four transhumans and a vampire
are sent on a spaceship to investigate an anomaly in the solar system after a
swarm of alien probes scan earth.

The main theme of the book is about consciousness and what it means to be
human. The five characters on the spaceship _Theseus_ are each mentally
different from baseline humans:

- Siri Keeton had half his brain removed and in doing so lost his sense of
  empathy and emotions. He attempts to emulate empathy by following a set of
  rules he learned.
- Amanda Bates's brain is connected to an army of robot soldiers.
- Susan James has had three additional personalities crafted to share her
  head.
- Isaac Szpindel has had so much of his body replaced by technology that he
  can directly interface with machines and his consciousness can live outside
  his body.
- Jukka Sarasti---a resurrected vampire---is far smarter than a human, faster,
  and probably not conscious.

The crew approaches a giant living-spaceship called _Rorschach_, and although
it appears to be able to communicate with them in English, they quickly
realize that it is simply pattern fitting and does not understand what they
are saying. The crew boards the _Rorschach_ several times, capturing some
aliens known as Scramblers, who are incredibly intelligent but, like Rorschach
and Sarasti, are not conscious.

The book argues that consciousness might have been accidentally selected for
in humans and is holding us back. Indeed, characters are generally more
capable as they have lower consciousness. James, with four personalities, is
taken over by the _Rorschach_ and forced to mutiny, while Siri with only half
a brain emulating humanity is the one who can see patterns the others miss.
The most capable characters---_Rorschach_, the Scramblers, and Sarasti---lack
consciousness completely and because of it are able to react faster, think
deeper thoughts, and plan further ahead.

The worldbuilding is fantastic and haunting. The mysteries are compelling and
their answers gratifying. The characters each feel alive---even the undead
one. <span class="book-title">Blindsight</span> is not a hopeful book, but it
is one of the best sci-fi books I've read.
