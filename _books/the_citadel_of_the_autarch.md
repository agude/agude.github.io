{{ this_book }} is the final book in the original series, and halfway through
I was worried {{ wolfe }} wouldn't be able to wrap it up successfully. By the
end, I thought he had done a marvelous job tying up almost all the loose ends
while leaving just enough of the mysteries to give the world depth.

One mystery left unsolved is the nature of the megatherians---the gigantic
beings that are trying to enslave humanity and who have enslaved the Ascians.
Are they Lovecraftian horrors from beyond the void, or humans who became
something more? Even here there are enough hints to let me ponder the question
without feeling hopeless. I think the megatherians are post-humans, and that
Balanders's ever increasing size and exit from the narrative into the water
hints he is on the way to becoming one.

Overall I enjoyed The Book of the New Sun, although I don't rate it as highly
as {{ ursula }}[^melville] or {{ neil }}[^best] do. The interplay of writing
and setting worked really well, and the stories have lingered in my mind even
after finishing. I hear the sequel, {{ urth_new_sun }}, answers more questions
in a different style. I look forward to reading it.
