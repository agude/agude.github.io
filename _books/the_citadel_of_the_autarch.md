<span class="book-title">The Citadel of the Autarch</span> is the forth book
in Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun tetralogy. It follows Severian as he
reaches the front in the war against the Ascians and assumed the role of
Autarch.


<span class="book-title">The Citadel of the Autarch</span> is the final book
in the original series, and so halfway through the book I was worried Wolfe
wouldn't be able to wrap it up successfully. By the end I thought he had done
a marvelous job. Almost all the loose ends had been tied up, enough of the
mysteries had been revealed, but a few still remained to give the world depth.

One mystery left unsolved is the megatherians---the gigantic beings that are
trying to enslave humanity and have enslaved the Ascians. Are they
Cthulu-esque horrors from beyond the void, or humans who became something
more. Even here there are enough hints to let me ponder the question without
it feeling hopeless. I think they're post-humans, and that Balanders is on his
way to becoming one with his ever increasing size and exit from the narrative
into the water.

Over all I enjoyed The Book of the New Sun, although I don't rate it as highly
as [Le Guin][lg][^melville] or [Gaiman][ng][^best]. I found the interplay of
the writing and the setting to worked really well, and the stories have been
bouncing around in my mind even after I finished them. I hear the sequel, {%

answers more questions. We'll see how it goes.
