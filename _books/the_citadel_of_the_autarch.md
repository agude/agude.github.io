<span class="book-title">The Citadel of the Autarch</span> is the forth book
in Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun tetralogy. It follows Severian as he
reaches the front in the war against the Ascians and assumed the role of
Autarch.

Half of the way through the book I wondered how Wolfe could possibly wrap up
the story, because <span class="book-title">The Citadel of the Autarch</span>
is the last book in original series. By the end I thought he had done a
marvelous job. Almost all the loose ends had been tied up, enough of the
mysteries had been revealed, but a few still remained.

One mystery left unsolved is the megatherians. But even that has enough hints
that let me ponder the question without it feeling hopeless. My take is that
Balanders is on his way to becoming one, with his ever increasing size and his
final exit into the water.
