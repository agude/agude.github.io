<span class="book-title">The Citadel of the Autarch</span> is the forth book
in Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun tetralogy. It follows Severian as he
reaches the front in the war against the Ascians and assumes the role of
Autarch.

<span class="book-title">The Citadel of the Autarch</span> is the final book
in the original series, and halfway through I was worried Wolfe wouldn't be
able to wrap it up successfully. By the end, I thought he had done a marvelous
job tying up almost all the loose ends while leaving just enough of the
mysteries to give the world depth.

One mystery left unsolved is the nature of the megatherians---the gigantic
beings that are trying to enslave humanity and who have enslaved the Ascians.
Are they Lovecraftian horrors from beyond the void, or humans who became
something more? Even here there are enough hints to let me ponder the question
without feeling hopeless. I think the megatherians are post-humans, and that
Balanders's ever increasing size and exit from the narrative into the water
hints he is on the way to becoming one.

Overall I enjoyed The Book of the New Sun, although I don't rate it as highly
as [Ursula K. Le Guin][lg][^melville] or [Neil Gaiman][ng][^best] do. The
interplay of writing and setting worked really well, and the stories have
lingered in my mind even after finishing. I hear the sequel, {% include

different style. I look forward to reading it.
