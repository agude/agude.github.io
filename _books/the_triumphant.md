{{ this_book }} is different from the earlier anthologies---{{ bolo10 }} and
{{ bolo11 }}---because it was written mainly by {{ author_evans }} and {{
author_weber }}, with {{ author_hollingsworth }} contributing to one story.
It's clear {{ author_evans_lastname }} and {{ author_weber_lastname }}
collaborated, since their stories share common themes. That makes this book
feel much closer to {{ laumers }} original single-author works like {{ bolo1
}} and {{ bolo2 }}.

The collection's three best stories---{{ little_red_hen }}, {{ little_dog_gone
}}, and {{ miles_to_go }}---explore the relationship between Bolos and their
crews, especially how those bonds can lead to disaster. The Bolos are a bit
like {{ murderbot }} from {{ all_systems }}: they develop emotional
attachments they worry will compromise them, even while also using those
feelings to drive them to self-sacrifice.

### {% short_story_title "The Farmer's Wife" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_evans }}</div>
{% rating_stars 2 %}

The Bolo Digger, long since converted into a tractor, is the only thing
standing between the blind, mouse-like Xykdap and the agricultural colony of
Matson's World. Meanwhile, Tillie Matson is transport director aboard the
_Star Cross_, which is carrying the last colonists and cattle to the planet
when it's attacked by the Xykdap. The ship is crippled, and Tillie now has to
care for her people on a journey 20 years longer than expected.

For this story to really work, {{ author_evans }} needed to pull off three
things:

1. Deliver some awesome Bolo action, because this is a Bolo book.
2. Develop the characters on the _Star Cross_ enough that we care about them
   and worry over their precarious situation.
3. Weave the two storylines together so they feel connected, not just
   coexisting.

I don't think she really succeeds at any of these. It's fun that Digger has
gone so deep into his farming role that he mistakes the Xykdap for pests and
even whips up chemical weapon "pesticides", something we've never seen Bolos
do before. But he only gets one or two real scenes, while most of the story
stays on the _Star Cross_ as the crew struggles to survive.

Even there, the story doesn't give us enough. Everything feels rushed.
Watching the colonists slowly figure out how to endure---like Watney in {{
martian }} or Crusoe in {{ robinson }}---could have been fun. Instead, the
narrative skips over 19 years and jumps straight to the ending where they
finally meet Digger on the planet.

You can also start to see the conservative seeds of the (horrible) {{ bolo7 }}
which she wrote with {{ ringo }} in the salt-of-the-earth farmers just trying
to make their way against a hostile world.

### {% short_story_title "Little Red Hen" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_evans }} and {{ author_hollingsworth }}</div>
{% rating_stars 5 %}

The recon Bolo LRH "Red" and her crew of eight dismount troopers and three
command staff are sent to scout a planet ahead of a Concordiat invasion. When
the rest of the fleet arrives, they find Red nearly destroyed and her entire
crew dead. What happened to them? And is it Red's fault?

This story mixes heavy action with a lot of technical detail, like {{ drakes
}} {{ as_our_strength_lessens }}, but also carries a strong human element. Red
is a mother figure to her "boys," and it's their deaths in service of the
mission that push her into madness. Her last act, after being recovered, is to
commit suicide because the officer assigned to court-martial her is her former
commander, and she knows he would destroy his own career rather than condemn
her.

In a sense, this story is _another_ rewrite of {{ laumers }} {{ field_test }},
just like {{ rogue_bolo }} was. It even directly references that earlier
story[^rogue] and uses it to foreshadow Red's reasons for her suicidal
behavior. When Red finally breaks at the end, it reminds me of HAL 9000 in {{
clarkes }} {{ space_odyssey }}, because she's torn apart by contradictory
orders: to protect her crew while also ensuring the intelligence they gathered
is uploaded. The deep connection between Red and her crew is like {{
the_last_command }}.

[^rogue]:
    > "They say the first Mark XX went and committed suicide on 'em; but,
    > hell, at least it had a reason. Doing its duty, upholding the honor of
    > the Brigade and all. That's what they said, anyway. But this little
    > baby, she's just starkers, no explanation, nuthin'..."

### {% short_story_title "Little Dog Gone" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_evans }}</div>
{% rating_stars 5 %}

The Bolo GWN Gawain is destroyed during a Deng invasion, and the planet it was
defending is overrun. Two hundred years later, a girl becomes obsessed with
the wreck, discovers it's still functional, and begins secretly repairing it.
She has to keep her work hidden, because an abandoned Bolo is considered too
dangerous. If the Navy found out it was still alive, they'd destroy it.

The story is partly a coming-of-age tale, following 'Lima over five years as
she and her bully-turned-partner Brad repair the Bolo, fall in love, and work
through their own problems. When the Deng finally return, the Bolo still isn't
fully restored and needs a brain transplant from Brad's mortally wounded,
genetically engineered dog to be battle-ready.

This story is similar to {{ a_relic_of_war }}, with an old abandoned Bolo that
should be shut down as a threat but instead becomes the only thing capable of
saving the town. It's also reminiscent of {{ final_mission }}, where children
awaken a forgotten Bolo that is then called on to repel a Deng invasion. The
genetically enhanced dogs reminded me of the Tines in {{ vinges }} {{ fire }}.

### {% short_story_title "Miles to Go" %}
<div class="written-by">by {{ author_weber }}</div>
{% rating_stars 5 %}

Nike, a special Mk. XXIII Bolo, is a test bed for advanced AI research and the
first of her kind to develop emotions. Her new commander, Paul Merrit, has to
hide her unique abilities from Bolo Command, since they would destroy her out
of fear. But when the planet Santa Cruz is attacked by an evil corporation and
Merrit is betrayed, Nike becomes the only thing standing between the civilians
and certain death.

This was my favorite Bolo story when I first read it 20 years ago, and it's
still my favorite on reread. {{ author_weber_lastname }} is known for his
[overly verbose world-building][pizza], but he **absolutely** knows how to set
up that moment where the good guys rally: the kind of scene that makes you
want to jump up and cheer because you know the villains have finally
overreached and are about to get what's coming to them. And he uses it to
great effect here.

{{ miles_to_go }} has the best action sequences of any Bolo story. The bad
guys throw everything they've got at Nike, but she wins through with both
brains and brawn. In that way, it's a lot like {{ murderbot }}: Bolos are
incredibly competent, and Nike is no exception.

This story pulls in pieces from many others. From {{ field_test }}, it takes
the distrust of smarter Bolos. From {{ the_last_command }}, the emotional bond
between commander and tank. From {{ final_mission }}, the forgotten Bolo
awakened at just the right time to fight off a new threat. From {{ youre_it
}}, the knock-off Bolo, here called Golems. And from {{ the_murphosensor_bomb
}}, a machine with emotions and emotional intelligence (MAX was written first,
but comes later in the timeline). The use of poetry throughout reminded me of
{{ simmonss }} {{ hyperion }}.
