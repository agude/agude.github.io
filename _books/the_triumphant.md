The Bolo Digger, long since converted into a tractor, is the only thing that
stands between the blind, mouse-like Xykdap and the agricultural colony of
Matson's World. Meanwhile, Tillie Matson is the transport director Aboard the
_Star Cross_ bringing the remaining colonists and cattle to the colony when
they come under Xykdap attack, which cripples the ship. She now has to take
care of her people on a trip 20 years longer than they expected.

I think for this story to be successful {{ author_evans }} had to do three
things:

1. She has to give us some awesome Bolo scenes, because this is a Bolo book.
2. She has to develop the characters on the _Star Cross_ enough that we care
   about them and are worried the precarious position they find themselves in.
3. She has to interleave the two storylines together; otherwise why have them
   in the same story?

I don't think she really succeeds at any of these. It's fun that Digger has
gone so far into his agricultural role that he thinks the Xykdap are some
virulent pest, and it's neat to see him whip up some pesticides since we've
never before seen Bolos use chemical weapons. But he only gets one or two real
scenes; most of the story takes place on the _Star Cross_ as they try to
survive.

But even there, there just aren't enough pages. Things feel rushed. Seeing the
colonists figure out how to survive like Mark Watney in {{ martian }} or the
Crusoe in {{ robinson }} could have been fun, but instead they leap over 19
years and skip right to the end where they meet Digger on the planet.
