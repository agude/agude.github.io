The Bolo Digger, long since converted into a tractor, is the only thing that
stands between the blind, mouse-like Xykdap and the agricultural colony of
Matson's World. Meanwhile, Tillie Matson is the transport director Aboard the
_Star Cross_ bringing the remaining colonists and cattle to the colony when
they come under Xykdap attack, which cripples the ship. She now has to take
care of her people on a trip 20 years longer than they expected.

I think for this story to be successful {{ author_evans }} had to do three
things:

1. She has to give us some awesome Bolo scenes, because this is a Bolo book.
2. She has to develop the characters on the _Star Cross_ enough that we care
   about them and are worried the precarious position they find themselves in.
3. She has to interleave the two storylines together; otherwise why have them
   in the same story?

I don't think she really succeeds at any of these. It's fun that Digger has
gone so far into his agricultural role that he thinks the Xykdap are some
virulent pest, and it's neat to see him whip up some pesticides since we've
never before seen Bolos use chemical weapons. But he only gets one or two real
scenes; most of the story takes place on the _Star Cross_ as they try to
survive.

But even there, there just aren't enough pages. Things feel rushed. Seeing the
colonists figure out how to survive like Mark Watney in {{ martian }} or the
Crusoe in {{ robinson }} could have been fun, but instead they leap over 19
years and skip right to the end where they meet Digger on the planet.

The recon Bolo LRH "Red" and here crew of eight dismount troopers and three
command staff are sent to scout a planet ahead of a Concordiat invasion. When
the rest of the fleet arrives they find Red nearly destroyed and her crew
dead. What happened to them, and is it Red's fault?

A story with a great mix of action and a lot of technical details, like {{
drakes }} {{ as_our_strength_lessens }}, but also a lot of humanity. Red is
more like a mother figure to her "boys", and it's their deaths in service of
the mission that drives her crazy. Her last act, after being recovered, is to
commit suicide because the officer who is going to run her court martial was
her former commander, and she knows he'll sacrifice his career rather than
harm her.

In a sense, this story is a _another_ rewrite of {{ laumers }} {{ field_test
}}, just like {{ rogue_bolo }} was; it even directly references the previous
stories[^rogue] and uses it to foreshadow that Red has a reason for her
suicidal behavior. When red finally breaks at the end, it reminds me a bit of
HAL 9000 in {{ clarkes }} {{ space_odyssey }}, because she does so due to the
contradictory orders to both protect her crew but also to hide upload the
intelligence they gathered. The deep connection between the Bolo and her crew
is like {{ relic_of_war }}.

[^rogue]:
    > "They say the first Mark XX went and committed suicide on 'em; but,
    > hell, at least it had a reason. Doing its duty, upholding the honor of
    > the Brigade and all. That's what they said, anyway. But this little
    > baby, she's just starkers, no explanation, nuthin'..."

The Bolo GWN Gawain is destroyed by the Deng invasion and the planets it's
guarding is overrun. Two-hundred years later, a girl becomes obsessed with the
Bolo's ruin, discovers it is still functional, and begins slowly repairing it.
She has to keep her work secret because an abandoned Bolo is dangerous and the
Navy would come destroy it if they knew it was still alive.

It is a bit a growing up story, taking place over five years as 'Lima and
her bully-to-lover Brad

Like A Relic of War
