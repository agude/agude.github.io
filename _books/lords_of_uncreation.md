The story of the {{ this_series }} has always been its main draw. {{ this_book
}} is my favorite of the series because it focuses the most on that story. The
writing has improved a bit too---I didn't find myself sighing or writing down
particularly bad sentences like I did with {{ fa1 }} and {{ fa2 }}---and even
my least favorite characters get some redemption.

But the book is far from perfect. It moves too slowly. A third of it is spent
reigniting the human civil war, just when I was ready to finally face the
Originators. Idris has been reduced to whining about destroying the
Architects. His argument that humanity shouldn't fight back was more
interesting the first time I saw it in things like {{ ender }}, {{ speaker }},
and {{ borg }}, but it's tiring now, just like it was in {{ judas }}. Not
every book needs to wrestle with who the real bad guys are. Sometimes, like in
{{ war }}: its the ones committing genocide against humanity.

This book reminded me of a bunch of others. Like {{ martines }} {{ memory }},
territories in {{ this_book }} are defined by contagious Throughway
connections, not by physical space. Both the Parthenon and the Teixcalaanli
have a ritual list they read of those who died in combat. The giant Hegemonic
ring around a star is like the rings around Harmonious Repose in {{ vinges }}
{{ fire }}. The human arks, where the rich plan to escape civilization with
their underclass of servants, remind me of Rapture in {{ bioshock }}.
Thinking-as-pollution that distorts space is like the Pale in {{ disco }}, and
the Architects as "thought and complex distortions" in Unspace echo the Eater
in {{ eater }}. The Host ship being a collection of loose scales reminded me
of {{ culture_series }} ships.

The Originators themselves borrow from several sources. When they project into
the Eye, they appear to each viewer as something terrifying, which reminded me
of how the Overlords look like devils in {{ childhood }}. The fact that
they're bluffing is similar to the eponymous wizards in {{ wizard }}. Their
psychological attack on Solace, telling her how insignificant she is, felt
like the Total Perspective Vortex in {{ hitchhikers }}; the fact that it's all
in her mind recalls the virtual War in Heaven from {{ surface }}. And the idea
that they're refugees from a previous universe reminds me of {{ last_question
}}.

I'm glad to be done with {{ this_series }}. It had some interesting ideas, but
it should have been shorter, more focused, and had a few more polish passes on
the writing. On to {{ picnic }} and {{ bolo11 }} next, before picking up {{
hyperion }} again for book club.
