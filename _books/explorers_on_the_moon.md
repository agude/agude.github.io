{{ this_book }} is the second half of the story that started in {{ tt16 }}. It
improves upon the previous book in almost every way: it is a little less
verbose, there is more slapstick, and there are surprising twists that are
artfully wrapped up. The plot also moves along a little faster.

The artwork remains the highlight, with stark, accurate drawings of the
lunar landscape. {{ the_author }} also fills the pages with a lot of cool
machines, like the space suits, tank, and of course the rocket. Overall a
massive improvement over the sparse, sound-stage like setting drawn in {{ tt2
}}.

The plot of {{ this_book }} moves a little faster, and there are multiple
problems <!-- What's the right word for little digressions that come up and
have to be solved?-->, culminating with the discovery of the stowaway Jorgen
aided by the traitor Wolff. Jorge was first seen in {{ tt8 }}, which suggests
that the unnamed enemy from the previous book was working for the nation of
Borduria. Following {{ the_authors }} focus on realism in this storyline, the
plot is resolved in dark and realistic manner compared to other Tintin
stories: Jorge is killed in a struggle with the reformed Wolff, who later
commits suicide by exiting  the airlock into space to give the rest of the
crew enough oxygen to make it back to Earth.

{{ tt16 }} and {{ this_book }} are a pinnacle of {{ this_series }} series,
showcasing {{ the_authors }} talent at both story-telling and drawing. I let
the kids pick the next book to read, and they agreed on {{ tt4 }}; expect that
review soon!
