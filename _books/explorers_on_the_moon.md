{{ this_book }} is the second half of the story that started in {{ tt16 }}. It
improves on the previous book in almost every way: it's a little less verbose,
there's more slapstick, and there are surprising twists that are smartly
wrapped up.

The artwork remains the highlight, with stark, precise drawings of the lunar
landscape. {{ the_author }} fills every panel with fascinating machines, from
the bulky spacesuits to the lunar rover and, of course, the rocket. Overall, a
massive improvement from the sparse, sound-stage-like setting drawn for {{ tt2
}}.

The plot of {{ this_book }} moves a little faster, and there are a series of
smaller challenges, culminating in the discovery of the stowaway Jorgen, who
is aided by the traitor Wolff. Jorgen first appeared in {{ tt8 }}, which
suggests that the unnamed enemies from the previous book were working for the
nation of Borduria.

Staying true to {{ the_authors }} focus on realism in this arc, the story ends
in a darker way than most other Tintin comics: Jorgen is killed during a
struggle with the reformed Wolff, who later sacrifices himself by exiting the
airlock into space to give the rest of the crew enough oxygen to make it back
to Earth. {{ the_author }} was compelled by the Church to soften this suicide
by implying that Wolff might have survived,[^ref] although the reference is so
weak that it barely registers.

[^ref]:
    > When the story was first published {{ the_author }} was persuaded by the
    > Church, against his wishes, to modify this part of the narrative to
    > allow for the possibility of a miracle. Wolff's letter refers to the
    > possibility that he might escape death, which dampens the suicidal tone.

Together, {{ tt16 }} and {{ this_book }} are a highlight of {{ this_series }},
showcasing {{ the_authors }} skill at both storytelling and illustration. I've
let the kids pick the next book to read, and they agreed on {{ tt4 }}; expect
that review soon!
