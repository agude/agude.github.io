<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the first installment in
<span class="author-name">{{ page.book_authors }}</span>'s <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> tetralogy. It follows the life of
Severian, a torturer and executioner on a dying Earth. The pacing is slow, but
Wolfe's worldbuilding is fantastic, crafting a setting that pulls the reader
in.

The book is narrated by Severian, a torturer exiled from his guild for showing
mercy by helping a victim commit suicide. It chronicles his life as he rises
to become the Autarch of his civilization. Like {{ hyperion }}---and the
opposite of {{ consider_phlebas }}---{{ this_book }} tells a seemingly small,
personal story that nonetheless affects and hints at larger forces and events
happening just out of sight. The reader only gets glimpses of these looming
mysteries, and I suspect part of the payoff of the series will be uncovering
what they are.

There are several motifs, the most obvious of which is the fragile boundary
between life and death. Severian cheats death multiple times---once at the
beginning of the book when he almost drowns (water is another motif) and again
later when he loses the flower duel. He is a torturer and an executioner. He
lives amongst the graves and mausoleums surrounding his guild.

{{ the_author }} uses archaic English, mixed with some Latin, to give the
world an old and alien feeling. I frequently looked up unfamiliar words,
although you can also treat them as a kind of "technobabble" and infer their
meanings from context. In this way, the experience is similar to reading {{
quantum_thief }}, which uses foreign words for a similar effect. I think {{
wolfes }} prose is more successful, because the prosody of archaic English
matches the rest of the text better. Still it makes for a dense, slow read.

{{ this_book }} is similar to {{ rajaniemis }} {{ quantum_thief }} in another
way: they both have very deep worldbuilding at their heart. Again I think {{
wolfes }} is more successful than {{ rajaniemis }} because {{ quantum_thief }}
feels like it dumps the worldbuilding over you in a torrent, while {{
this_book }} leaves it hidden in the nooks and crannies of the story for you
to slowly uncover, making it feel more organic.
