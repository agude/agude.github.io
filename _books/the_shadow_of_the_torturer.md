<span class="book-title">The Shadow of the Torturer</span> is the first part
of The Book of the New Sun.

Wolfe uses archaic English, mixed with some Latin, to give the world an old
and alien feeling. I frequently looked up unfamiliar words, although you can
also treat them as a kind of "technobabble" and infer their meanings from
context. In this way, the experience is similar to reading {% include
book_link.html title="The Quantum Thief" %}, which uses foreign words for a
similar effect. I think Wolfe's prose is more successful, because the prosody
of archaic English matches the rest of the text better. Still it makes for a
dense, slow read.

<span class="book-title">The Shadow of the Torturer</span> is similar to
Rajaniemi's {% include book_link.html title="The Quantum Thief" %} in another
way: they both have very deep worldbuilding at their heart. Again I think
Wolfe's is more successful than Rajaniemi's because {% include book_link.html
title="The Quantum Thief" %} feels like it dumps the worldbuilding over you in
a torrent, while <span class="book-title">The Shadow of the Torturer</span>
leaves it hidden in the nooks and crannies of the story for you to slowly
uncover, making it feel more organic.

The book is narrated by Severian, a torturer thrown out of his guild for
showing mercy by assisting a victim in committing suicide, and chronicles his
life as he raises to become the Autarch of his civilization. Like {% inclue
book_link.html link="Hyperion" %}---and the opposite of {% include
book_link.html title="Consider Phlebas"%}---<span class="book-title">The
Shadow of the Torturer</span> is a seemingly small-scale story with much
larger happenings going on under the surface. The reader only gets hints at
these, and I suspect part of the payoff of the series will be uncovering what
those happening are. I can't wait to find out.
