<span class="book-title">The Shadow of the Torturer</span> is the first part
of The Book of the New Sun.

The prose in the book is very dense. My reading speed was cut in half.

Wolfe uses archaic English, mixed with some Latin, to give the world an old
and alien feeling. I frequently looked up unfamiliar words, although you can
also treat them as a kind of "technobabble" and infer their meanings from
context. In this way, the experience is similar to reading {% include
book_link.html title="The Quantum Thief" %}, which uses foreign words for a
similar effect. I think Wolfe's prose is more successful, because the prosody
of archaic English matches the rest of the text better.
