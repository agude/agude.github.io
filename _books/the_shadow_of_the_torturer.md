<span class="book-title">The Shadow of the Torturer</span> is the first part
of The Book of the New Sun.

The prose in the book is very dense. My reading speed was cut in half.

Wolfe uses archaic English, mixed with some Latin, to give the world
an old and alien feeling. I constantly looked up new words, although you can
just as well treat them as "technobabble" and infer their meaning from
context. In this way the experience is similar to reading {% include
book_link.html title="The Quantum Thief" %}, which uses foreign words to
similar effect. I think Wolfe's usage was more successful, because the prosody
of old English matches the rest of the text.
