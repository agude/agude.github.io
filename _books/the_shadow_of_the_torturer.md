<span class="book-title">The Shadow of the Torturer</span> is the first
installment in Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun tetralogy. The pacing may
be slow, but Wolfe's worldbuilding is fantastic, crafting a setting that pulls
the reader in.

Wolfe uses archaic English, mixed with some Latin, to give the world an old
and alien feeling. I frequently looked up unfamiliar words, although you can
also treat them as a kind of "technobabble" and infer their meanings from
context. In this way, the experience is similar to reading {% include
book_link.html title="The Quantum Thief" %}, which uses foreign words for a
similar effect. I think Wolfe's prose is more successful, because the prosody
of archaic English matches the rest of the text better. Still it makes for a
dense, slow read.

<span class="book-title">The Shadow of the Torturer</span> is similar to
Rajaniemi's {% include book_link.html title="The Quantum Thief" %} in another
way: they both have very deep worldbuilding at their heart. Again I think
Wolfe's is more successful than Rajaniemi's because {% include book_link.html
title="The Quantum Thief" %} feels like it dumps the worldbuilding over you in
a torrent, while <span class="book-title">The Shadow of the Torturer</span>
leaves it hidden in the nooks and crannies of the story for you to slowly
uncover, making it feel more organic.

The book is narrated by Severian, a torturer exiled from his guild for showing
mercy by helping a victim commit suicide. It chronicles his life as he rises
to become the Autarch of his civilization. Like {% include book_link.html
title="Hyperion" %}---and the opposite of {% include book_link.html
title="Consider Phlebas"%}---<span class="book-title">The Shadow of the
Torturer</span> tells a seemingly small, personal story that hints at larger
forces and events happening just out of sight. The reader only gets glimpses
of these looming mysteries, and I suspect part of the payoff of the series
will be uncovering what they are.

There are a several motifs, the most obvious of which is the fragile boundary
between life and death. Severian almost dies several times. He is a torturer
and an executioner. He lives amongst the graves and mausoleums surrounding his
guild.
