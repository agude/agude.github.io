I've been meaning to read <span class="author-name">Banks</span>'s <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> series for more than two decades,
so I was excited to finally get started. Unfortunately, <cite
class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> was not a great introduction.

The book is considered a "space opera", and there are some hints at
interesting, grand ideas: a ship that can set off every warhead on board to
send a coded message while still escaping the blast, a truly galactic scale
war, and giant trains used as underground command centers. But the story
itself feels small compared to those ideas. It is the story of one man, Horza.

Horza bumbles his way from situation to situation, each one worse than the
last. He is unlikable, unskilled, and has little impact on the world.[^banks]
His vignettes are nasty, brutish, and short. {{ bankss }} use of violence and
gruesome imagery---something [he is infamous for][wasp]---is off putting.

    Banks says this is the point:

    > I've read so many SF books where the action is terribly, terribly
    > important to the fate of everyone and everything. That fate of a whole
    > planet can hang on the outcome of a protagonist's actions. Sometimes,
    > the fate of the entire universe! Well, if you look at history, this is
    > very unusual indeed. What usually happens is that people suffer and die
    > and get involved in all sorts of mayhem and catastrophe and it doesn't
    > make that much difference in the end.
    >
    > That was one of the ideas behind {{ this_book }}.

I think that Horza's bleak reality is supposed to contrast with his belief
that his side of the war is the more enlightened one, but it was just
unpleasant to read about him _drowning in literal shit_ and _having his
fingers chewed off_.

I hope that {{ c2 }} better.
