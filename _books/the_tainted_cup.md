{{ this_book }} is (and this is going to sound crazy) a Holmesian detective
story set in a bio-punk fantasy world inspired by imperial China. And there
are Kaiju monsters who leave the ocean every year to attack the empire's
walls. It is inspired by works like the stores of Sherlock Holmes, <cite>Attack on
Titan</cite>, <cite>Pacific Rim</cite>, {{ botns }}, and local zoning
boards.[^zoning]

[^zoning]:
    Not joking! Bennett mentions this in his afterwards, and it is pretty
    obvious from the text itself which makes constant use of "Preservation
    Boards".

{{ this_book }}'s worldbuilding is fantastic, and unlike the last book I read,
{{ house }}, and exists  in service of the story. The world feels organic
because it isn't built through lore dumps, but through the characters living
in it.

The main characters are Dinios Kol, a new investigator, and his superior and
partner, Ana Dolabra. Kol is a dyslexic Watson with eidetic memory, while
Dolabra is an over-stimulated, foul-mouthed Sherlock Holmes.
