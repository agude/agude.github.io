<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a fantasy detective novel
set in a world where humanity is on the brink of destruction from giant Kaiju.
It follows investigators Dinios Kol and Ana Dolabra as they try to solve the
murder of an engineer and uncover a conspiracy that runs far deeper.

{{ this_book }} is (and this is going to sound crazy) a Holmesian detective
story set in a bio-punk fantasy world inspired by imperial China, where Kaiju
monsters leave the ocean every year to attack the empire's walls. It draws
inspiration from Sherlock Holmes, <cite>Attack on Titan</cite>, <cite>Pacific
Rim</cite>, {{ botns }}, and surprisingly, local zoning boards.[^zoning]

[^zoning]:
    Not joking! The author, Bennett, specifically mentions this in his
    afterwards, but it is also pretty obvious from the text itself, in which
    preservation boards act as an enabler of the larger conspiracy.

The main characters are Dinios Kol, a new investigator, and his superior, Ana
Dolabra. Kol is a dyslexic Watson with eidetic memory, while Dolabra is an
over-stimulated, foul-mouthed Sherlock Holmes. They are called to solve the
murder of an imperial engineer, leading them to uncover a deeper conspiracy.

{{ this_book }}'s worldbuilding is fantastic! Most technology is plant-based,
and many people have had their bodies enhanced in various ways to better suit
their jobs---like Dinios's eidetic memory. Unlike {{ house }}, the last book I
read, the worldbuilding exists in service of the story. The world feels
organic because it isn't built through lore dumps but through the characters
living in it. Half the excitement of reading {{ this_book }} comes from
unraveling the central mystery, while the other half comes from gradually
uncovering and understanding the intricacies of the setting.

{{ this_book }} also pays homage to {{ wolfes }} {{ botns }}.[^botns] The
first chapter, with Dinios's arrival at the Haza manor, mirrors Severian's
arrival at the citadel in the opening chapter of {{ torturer }}: an officer of
the law with perfect memory arrives at a wall in the mist and finds his way
barred by a gate; he is reluctantly let through and finds a body inside. Later
in {{ this_book }}, we learn that there are immortal Conzulates who, just like
{{ wolfes }} Megatherians, achieve immortality through constant growth.
Moreover, the idea of "giant underwater monsters trying to destroy the Empire"
applies to both the Megatherians and the Kaiju, although the Kaiju are more
direct in their destructive actions.

[^botns]:
    I feel like I'm in danger of succumbing to the traditional ailment of {{
    botns }} fans: seeing connections where there are none.

I really enjoyed the characters in {{ this_book }} and its unique setting. The
book is the first part in an as-of-yet unwritten series, and it left enough
questions about the world unanswered for the next few books to explore. I look
forward to reading them!
