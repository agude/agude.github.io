{{ this_book }} is (and this is going to sound crazy) a Holmesian detective
story set in a bio-punk fantasy world inspired by imperial China. And there
are Kaiju monsters who leave the ocean every year to attack the empire's
walls. It is inspired by things like the stories of Sherlock Holmes,
<cite>Attack on Titan</cite>, <cite>Pacific Rim</cite>, {{ botns }}, and local
zoning boards.[^zoning]

[^zoning]:
    Not joking! Bennett mentions this in his afterwards, and it is pretty
    obvious from the text itself which makes constant use of "Preservation
    Boards".

{{ this_book }}'s worldbuilding is fantastic, and unlike the last book I read,
{{ house }}, and exists in service of the story. The world feels organic
because it isn't built through lore dumps, but through the characters living
in it. Half of the excitement of the book is unraveling the mystery, the other
half is unraveling the setting and finding out how it works.

The main characters are Dinios Kol, a new investigator, and his superior and
partner, Ana Dolabra. Kol is a dyslexic Watson with eidetic memory, while
Dolabra is an over-stimulated, foul-mouthed Sherlock Holmes.

{{ this_book }} pays homage to {{ wolfes }} {{ botns }}.[^botns] The first
chapter, with Dinios's arrival at the Haza manor mirrors, Severian's arrival
at the citadel in the first chapter of {{ torturer }}: an officer of the law,
who has perfect memory, arrives at a wall in the mist and finds his way barred
by a gate; he is let through reluctantly and finds a body inside. Later in {{
this_book }}, we learn that there are immortal Conzulates who, just like {{
wolfes }} Megatharians, achieve immortality through constant growth.

[^botns]:
    I feel like I am in dangers of succumbing to the traditional ailment of {{
    botns }} fans: seeing connections where there are none.
