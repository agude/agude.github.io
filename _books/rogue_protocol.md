<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite>, by <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>, is the third book in the
<span class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span>. It follows Murderbot as it
investigates a GrayCris terraforming station and, you guessed it, saves a
group of humans.

{{ this_book }} keeps up the pace and mix of action and exposition from {{ mb2
}}. Murderbot stowsaway aboard a ship taking a salvage team to the GrayCris
station, only to discover that they brought their own, human, security. The
SecUnit has to hide from them while finding evidence that the station is
actually an illegal alien-relic mining operation.

The primary theme of this story is Murderbot's relationship with humans, and
what it wants out of that relationship. This is exemplified by Miki---the
"pet" robot that accompanies the group---and how Murderbot is simultaneously
horrified and jealous of how the humans treat the bot like a friend. It also
shows in the comparison between Murderbot and the human security consultants,
and how they are less competent at all aspects of their jobs.

{{ this_book }} is like a pop-version of {{ wattss }} {{ blindsight }}. The
abandoned station hovering in the clouds is like Rorschach above Big Ben. Both
are explored by humans and full of dangerous, non-sentient opponents. Both
books have themes relating to the self and the mind. But {{ blindsight }}, of
course, is much darker and dives much deeper into questions of the mind and
consciousness, while {{ this_book }} keeps it light and action packed.

I once again enjoyed watching the hyper-competent Murderbot navigate the
dangers of the station and save the people. Onward to {{ mb4 }}.
