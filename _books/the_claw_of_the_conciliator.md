<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is the second book in <span
class="author-name">{{ page.book_author }}</span>'s <span
class="book-series">{{ page.series }}</span> tetralogy. It picks up right
where {% book_link "The Shadow of the Torturer" %} leaves
off, following Severian as he makes his way towards Thrax.

The book is very similar to {{ shadow_torturer }}: Florid writing, slow pace,
lots of themes and allegories, and mysteries that are exposed only to be
replaced by new ones.

There are many scenes that I loved:

- The fair, greenman, and executions in Saltus.

- The ape-men and the leviathan underground.

- The macabre feast of Thecla.

- The attack by the shadow creatures.

- The antechamber prison and the ancestral prisoners.

- The reveal of the Autarch's identity and that he works in some way with the
  man who would overthrow him---Vodalus.

But the book begins to drag in the second half and the story seems to wander.
Knowing there are three more installments ahead of me in the {{ this_series }}
series, I'm worried it will grind to a halt. I hope that {{ sword_lictor }}
will pick up the pace.
