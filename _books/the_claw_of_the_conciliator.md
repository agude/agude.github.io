<span class="book-title">The Claw of the Conciliator</span> is the second book
in Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun tetralogy. It picks up right where {%
include book_link.html title="The Shadow of the Torturer" %} following
Severian as he makes his way towards Trask.

The book is very similar to {% include book_link.html title="The Shadow of the
Torturer" %}: Florid writing, slow going, lots of themes and allegories,
and mysteries that are exposed only to be replaced by ones.

There are many scenes that I loved:

- The fair, greenman, and executions in Saltus.
- The ape-men and the leviathan underground.
- The attack by the futuristic shadow drones.
- The macabre feast of Thecla.
- The antechamber prison and the ancestral prisoners.
- The reveal of the Autarch identity and that he works in some way with the
  man who would overthrow him---Vodalus.

But the book begins to drag in the second half and the story seems to wander.
Knowing there are three more ahead of me in the series, I'm worried it will
grind to a halt. I hope that {% include book_link.html title="The Sword of the
Lictor" %} will pick up the pace.
