The cover sports a quote from a Newsweek review: "Marries {{ chandlers }}
style and {{ pkds }} vision." I've read none of {{ r_chandler }}, and little {{
full_pkd }}, but this quote sums up {{ this_book }} genre perfectly. From
{{ chandler }} it brings in Metcalf---the hardboild, down-on-his-luck private
eye---and Phoneblum---the gangster---and too many "dames" and "broads" to
count. From {{ pkd }} it borrows a focus on dystopian and surreal technology, drug use,
cryogenic prisons, karma as a real currency, and uplifted animals.

The world in {{ this_book }} is bleak. It's obviously bad, with murder,
techno-slaves, engineered babies, drug use for control of the citizenry,
overbearing police, and curtailed rights. But it is even worse in the hinted
details: organized rapes by the police, a prison-to-slavery system, and an
entire class of people that have no rights. And because it is a hardboild
novel, we see it at street level through Metcalf's eyes, with all the grime
and violence washing up against him. It makes it feel much more visceral than
if it were written in another genre.
