The cover sports a quote from a Newsweek review: "Marries {{ chandlers }}
style and {{ pkds }} vision." I've read none of {{ r_chandler }}, and little
{{ full_pkd }}, but this quote sums up {{ this_book }}'s genre perfectly. From
{{ chandler }} it brings in Metcalf---the hardboiled, down-on-his-luck private
eye---and Phoneblum---the gangster---too many "dames" and "broads" to
count, and the prose. From {{ pkd }} it borrows a focus on dystopian and
surreal technology, drug use, cryogenic prisons, karma as a real currency, and
uplifted animals.

The world in {{ this_book }} is bleak. The parts made explicit in the novel
are bad: murder, gangsters, techno-slaves, engineered babies, drug use for
control of the citizenry, overbearing police, and curtailed rights. But it is
even worse in the more subtle, blink-and-you'll-miss-them details: organized
rapes by the police, a prison-to-slavery system, an entire class of people
that have no rights. Because it is a hardboiled novel, we see it at street
level through Metcalf's eyes, with all the grime and violence washing up
against him. This makes it feel much more visceral than if it were written in
another genre.

The mystery is a standard whodunit, with Metcalf trying to solve the murder of
Dr. Stanhunt. Metcalf discovers an underworld where the gangster
Phoneblum---and his enforcer, an uplifted kangaroo---sell illegal drugs, run
slavery prostitution rings, and kill freely. Wanting to put all the pieces
together is enough to keep the reader going, but the mystery isn't itself the
focus. Instead, what intrigued me the most was the world, but it was
unfortunately only seen in passing. In a way, it's similar to {{ lpm1 }}, in
which the apocalyptic setting carries the book instead of the murder mystery,
although {{ lpm1 }} is a far less bleak book, despite the impending end of
humanity.

One thing I felt the book missed was a connection to its setting. It takes
place in Oakland and Berkeley, but other than dropping some street names, it
feels like it could actually be anywhere. I think part of the reason is the
setting has changed so much from the present day that only the geography
remains.

Overall, I enjoyed the book because of the world, although it made me feel
uncomfortable, and the mystery was good enough to keep me interested.
