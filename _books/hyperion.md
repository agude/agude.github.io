<span class="book-title">Hyperion</span>, was not at all the book I expected.
To give you an idea of how much I misjudged what the book would be like, about
a third of the way through I would have rated it two stars and almost put it
down, about two-thirds of the way through I was solidly at three stars, and by
the end I was up to four. It's not the all-time great I was expecting, but it
was good.

It is told as the tale of six different pilgrims visiting the planet Hyperion,
and is very much <span class="book-title">[The Canterbury Tales][tales]</span>
in space. At first the stories seem unconnected, but as the pilgrims travel
and tell their stories we realize they are all connected, and they reveal a
hint at the wider universe that the book takes place in.

### The Priest's Tale
{% include book_rating.html rating=2 %}

I think this story is supposed to be carried by the mystery, but it didn't
hook me. Not as much a horror story as I assumed halfway through, it's still a
little too far into the genre for me.

### The Soldier's Tale
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

A story with action, mystery, and our first really good look at the Shrike.

### The Poet's Tale
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

Starts off slow, but the payoff is good.

### The Scholar's Tale
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

Emotional, heartbreaking. In the Scholar's Tale we learn why he brought a
two-week old baby (and getting younger all the time) on the deadly pilgrimage.

### The Detective's Tale
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

This story that gives us a great look at he TechnoCore: the artificial
intelligences that succeed from humanity but are still tightly involved. The
story hints that the TechnoCore's three factions---the stables, the volatiles,
and the ultimates---are engineering the coming war over Hyperion. The end is a
bit too 1980s cyberpunk (dodging code phages in the neon cyberweb!), but the
characters and history are compelling.
