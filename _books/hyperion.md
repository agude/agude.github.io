<span class="book-title">Hyperion</span>, was not at all the book I expected.
To give you an idea of how much I misjudged what the book would be like, about
a third of the way through I would have rated it two stars and almost put it
down, about two-thirds of the way through I was solidly at three stars, and by
the end I was up to four. It's not the all-time great I was expecting, but it
was very good.

It is told as the tale of six different pilgrims visiting the planet Hyperion
to visit the Shrike, a cruel, death-god-like figure. <span
class="book-title">Hyperion</span> is very much <span class="book-title">[The
Canterbury Tales][tales]</span> in space. At first the stories seem
unconnected, but as the pilgrims travel and tell their stories we realize they
are all connected, and they reveal a hint at the wider universe that the book
takes place in. The book ends "suddenly" but the sequel, {% include
book_link.html title="The Fall of Hyperion"%}, picks up right where <span
class="book-title">Hyperion</span> leaves off.

A theme that runs through the book is "the old gods replaced by the new",
based on Keat's <span class="book-title">[Hyperion][hyperion]</span> poem
about the [Greek Titans falling to the new Gods of Olympus][titanomachy]. We
see this with the Humans and the AI TechnoCore, the humans and the Ousters (a
breakaway post-human faction), the Scholar and the Old Testament God, and
Catholicism and the new religions.

### The Priest's Tale
{% include book_rating.html rating=2 %}

I think this story is supposed to be carried by the mystery, but it didn't
hook me. Not as much a horror story as I assumed halfway through, it's still a
little too far into the genre for me.

### The Soldier's Tale
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

A story with action, mystery, and our first really good look at both the
Ousters and the Shrike.

### The Poet's Tale
{% include book_rating.html rating=3 %}

Starts off slow, but the payoff is good. Silenus, the poet, is a spoiled
annoying character, but the way he comes to believe he has set the Shrike
loose with his writing is exciting.

### The Scholar's Tale
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

Emotional, heartbreaking. In the Scholar's Tale we learn why Sol Weintraub
brought a two-week old baby---one getting younger all the time---on the deadly
pilgrimage.

### The Detective's Tale
{% include book_rating.html rating=5 %}

This story that gives us a great look at he TechnoCore: the artificial
intelligences that succeed from humanity but are still tightly involved. The
story hints that the TechnoCore's three factions---the stables, the volatiles,
and the ultimates---are engineering the coming war over Hyperion. The end is a
bit too 1980s cyberpunk (dodging code phages in the neon cyberweb!), but the
characters and history are compelling.

### The Consul's Tale
{% include book_rating.html rating=4 %}

The final tale starts off as a love story between a planet-bound woman and a
space-faring man who, because of relativity, ages much slower. But at the very
end the story twists and it becomes a story or revolution, and explains who
the Consul's actions intentionally set the entire Hyperion crisis in motion.
