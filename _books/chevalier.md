<span class="book-title">Chevalier</span> is a modern reimagining of 1980's
mech sci-fi like Battletech. It is a quick read with lots of action and not a
lot else, but that was exactly what I was looking for.

The plot is a classic: Vandal is an upright tank---what mechs are called
in-universe---mechanic in a mercenary company. When some mysterious and badass
other mercenaries decimate his unit, he's forced to put down the wrench and
become a pilot, which he is naturally gifted at. He makes friends with the
other new pilots, is shoved into combat much too quickly out of necessity, and
triumphs over the mercenaries who first defeated his unit, although not in the
way you would expect if this were just a simple action-movie.

The universe is interesting. It is an alternate history earth where [Baghdad
wasn't sacked in 1258][sack], leading to space flight during the crusades, and
cementing the Spanish and Arabs as the two major powers. But the story focuses
very tightly on Vandal and people around him, so not much of the setting is
explored. I hope we learn more about the setting in the next novel in the
series, {% include book_link.html title="Ymir" %}.

Overall an enjoy action romp.
