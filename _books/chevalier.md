<cite class="book-title">{{ page.title }}</cite> is a modern reimagining of 1980's
mech sci-fi like Battletech, Gundam, and Macross. It's a quick, action-packed
read---not very deep but highly entertaining---that focuses on making mechs
feel like realistic battlefield tech, not magic.

The plot of {{this_book }}is a classic: Vandal is a mech (called upright
tanks) mechanic in a mercenary company. When mysterious, badass mercenaries
decimate his unit, he's forced to become a pilot instead, a role he is
naturally gifted at. He befriends the other new pilots and is thrust into
combat prematurely out of necessity, triumphing over the rival mercenaries in
an unexpected way.

The setting is an alternate history where [Baghdad was never sacked in
1258][sack]. This led to space flight during the crusades, cementing the
nobles from Spain, Portugal, and France as one major power, with
descendants of the Saracen as the other. But the story focuses tightly on
Vandal and those around him, so the wider setting remains under-explored.
Hopefully more background comes in the sequel, {{ ymir }}.

Overall an enjoyable action romp.
