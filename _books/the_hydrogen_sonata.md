{{ this_book }} is a fitting end to the {{ this_series }}. It pairs perfectly
with {{ c1 }}, as both explore the insignificance of a single being in the
broader galaxy. {{ c1 }} approaches this theme from a negative
perspective---Horza is battered, tortured, and leaves a wake of destruction
before failing at his quest, which nonetheless has no impact on the war or the
wider world. In contrast, {{ this_book }} looks at the theme in a more
positive light---Vyr Cossont embarks on adventures, succeeds at her
self-appointed life-task, completes her mission, and it still means nothing.

The main theme of the book is that life is meaningless except for the meaning
you give it and the legacy you leave. In this way, it is a fitting final book
for {{ the_author_link }}.[^last] The plot reinforces this theme with many
twists, branches, and dead-ends that all lead nowhere---the great revelation
everyone struggled either to bring forth or to bury is discovered, repressed,
and nothing comes of it.

Each character finds their own meaning in the story: Vyr takes on the
life-task of playing the titular Hydrogen Sonata. The barbaric Colonel Cagad
Agansu derives meaning from his position in the military hierarchy, regardless
of what it demands of him. Reikl's meaning comes from serving and dying
honorably.  The revelers on the _Equatorial 353_ find meaning in hedonism. The
drone, Hassipura Plyn-Frie, shapes rocks and sand into kinetic sculptures.
Ngaroe QiRia immerses himself in sound.

[^last]: 
    It is the last book published under the author's "{{ the_author }}" name.
    A final book, {{ the_quarry }}, was published posthumously under the name
    "{{ iain_banks }}".

{{ this_book }} includes callbacks to previous books in the series: a meteor
storm devastates the early Glitz civilization just as in {{ c6 }}. Music and
composers play a central role, as in {{ c7 }}. The Interesting Times Gang from
{{ c5 }} is mentioned, and the group of ships meddling with the Glitz is
reminiscent of them. The virtual heavens and hells of {{ c9 }} echo the real
heaven of Subliming. The debate over whether the ships can ethically intervene
in the Glitz civilization mirrors themes from {{ c2 }}, {{ c3 }}, {{ c4 }},
and many others mentioned earlier---one could almost say this is a constant
theme in {{ the_authors }} works.

I expected reading {{ this_book }} to be sad because it was the last
book---and it was---but I didn't expect its melancholy theme to also make me
feel hopeful. Life is what you make of it. Bittersweet, indeed.
