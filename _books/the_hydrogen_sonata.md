{{ this_book }} is a fitting end to the {{ this_series }}. It pairs with {{ c1
}} perfectly, as both explore the insignificance of a single being in the
broader galaxy. {{ c1 }} approaches this theme from a negative point of
view---Horza is battered, tortured, and leaves a wake of destruction before
failing at his quest, which none-the-less has no impact on the war or wider
world. {{ this_book }} looks at it in a more positive light---Vyr Cossont goes
on adventures, succeeds at her self appointed life-task, successfully
completes her mission, and it still means nothing.

The main theme of the book is life, how it is meaningless expect for the
meaning you give it, and the legacy you leave. In this way it is a fitting
last book for {{ the_author_link }}.[^last] The plot reinforces the theme by
having many twists, branches, and dead-ends only to lead nowhere: the great
revelation everyone struggled to bring forth or bury is repressed and nothing
comes of it.

Each character makes their own meaning in the story: Vyr takes on a life-task
of playing the titular Hydrogen Sonata. The barbaric Colonel Cagad Agansu
derives meeting from his place in the military hierarchy, regardless of what
it asks of him. Reikl's meaning comes from serving, and dying, honorably. The
drone, Hassipura Plyn-Frie, shapes rocks and sand. Ngaroe QiRia emersses
himself in sound.

[^last]: 
    It is the last book published under the author's "{{ the_author }}" name.
    A final book, {{ the_quarry }}, was published posthumously under the name
    "{{ iain_banks }}".

{{ this_book }} had some callbacks to previous books in the series: a meteor
storm devastates the early Glitz civilization just like in {{ c6 }}. Music and
composers are a central point, like {{ c7 }}. The Interesting Times Gang from
{{ c5 }} is mentioned, and the group of ships meddling with the Glitz is
reminiscent of them. The virtual heavens and hells of {{ c9 }} echo the real
heaven of Subliming. The debate over whether the ships can ethically intervene
mirrors themes from {{ c2 }}, {{ c3 }}, {{ c4 }}, and many others already
mentioned---one could almost say this is a constant theme of {{ the_authors }}
works.

I expected reading {{ this_book }} to be sad because it was the last
book---and it was---but I did not expect this to be reinforced by the
melancholy theme, or to make me feel so hopeful. Bittersweet, indeed.
