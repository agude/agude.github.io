# Copyedit Skill

Edit drafts for alexgude.com while preserving voice and style.

## Usage

- `/copyedit grammar` --- Fix only spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Change nothing else.
- `/copyedit polish` --- Fix errors, improve clarity, reword for coherence. Preserve voice.

If no mode is specified, ask which mode to use.

## Instructions

### Grammar Mode

Fix ONLY:
- Spelling errors
- Grammar mistakes (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency)
- Punctuation errors
- Typos

### Polish Mode

Follow this prompt:
> Fix errors, make it clearer. Reword to make the arguments and sentences more coherent. Use the same sort of words I'm using, don't substitute fancy synonyms. Maintain my voice.

You may:
- Fix all grammar/spelling issues
- Restructure sentences for clarity
- Improve flow between ideas
- Cut unnecessary words

You must:
- Preserve the author's vocabulary---don't upgrade "good" to "exceptional"
- Keep the same level of formality
- Maintain opinions and judgments as written
- Preserve all Liquid tags and formatting exactly

## Output Format

Add the edited copy to the bottom of the article, separated by a markdown HR break.

For grammar mode, just change in place, and also list the changes made so the author can review them.

## Voice & Style Guide

See [references/STYLE.md](references/STYLE.md) for the complete style guide.

Key points:
- **Tone**: First-person, conversational but substantive, direct and opinionated
- **Vocabulary**: Simple, direct words. "great", "fun", "loved"---not "exceptional", "delightful", "adored"
- **Hedging**: Avoid. Say "I didn't like it" not "I perhaps didn't fully appreciate it"
- **Em-dashes**: Do NOT add em-dashes. LLMs overuse them. Only keep existing ones if appropriate.
- **Contractions**: Use naturally
- **Oxford comma**: Yes

### Anti-patterns (never do these)

- Don't add too many em-dashes (---)
- Don't add emojis
- Don't add exclamation marks unless the original has them
- Don't use "delve", "tapestry", "nuanced", "compelling"
- Don't add hedging words ("perhaps", "somewhat", "rather")
- Don't make it sound more formal or academic
- Don't add superlatives or intensifiers

## Book Review Structure

See [references/BOOK-REVIEWS.md](references/BOOK-REVIEWS.md) for details on book review structure.

Key constraints:
- **First paragraph**: Uses `{{ page.title }}`, `{{ page.book_authors }}`, etc. No custom plugin tags. This paragraph is pulled out for social media previews, so it must stand alone.
- **After first paragraph**: `{% capture %}` blocks define template variables, then prose continues using those variables.
- **Paragraph 2 transition**: The challenge is prose flow---don't repeat too much of what paragraph 1 just said. Find a new angle or continue the thought. Generally the author has already tried to do this but help them a bit.
- **References to other works**: These create backlinks, so mentioning other books/authors is encouraged, but again the author will have filled in most of these. You may suggest others.

## Plugin Reference

See [references/PLUGINS.md](references/PLUGINS.md) for the full plugin reference.

Common tags you'll encounter:
- `{% book_link "Title" %}` --- link to a book
- `{% author_link "Name" %}` --- link to an author (supports `possessive`, `link_text=`)
- `{% series_link "Series" %}` --- link to a series
- `{% capture var %}...{% endcapture %}` --- define reusable variables

Do not modify these tags. Preserve them exactly as written.
