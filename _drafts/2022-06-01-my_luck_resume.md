I am currently a staff-level machine learning engineer at a major tech
company.

8 years ago I was a PhD student unsure of what to do next.

18 years ago I was just starting college and knew I was going to be a
physicist.

# Coding

I started writing code on my Ti-83 in high school instead of doing math
class.I realized I could make the calculator do a lot of work for me and that
drew me in. Soon I was making text based GUIs and even (really bad) games like
"move the Ï€ symbol around the screen". I later took these skills and started
making really complicated Excel spread sheets for roleplaying games that would
track my character's power-level and progression and role dice for me.

When I got to college I tried to learn Java, but I had no motivation to use
it. There were no problems I was trying to solve.

# LBL

I realized in 2005 that I needed to get a summer research position if I wanted
to be a physicist (and I did). I didn't really know how to go about it though.
Luckily for me, my good friend from high school had an aunt how worked as an
executive assistant at Lawrence Berkeley Labs (LBL). My mom heard from my
friend's mom that [Saul Perlmutter's][saul] group, the [Supernova Cosmology
Project][scp] (SCP) was looking for undergraduates. I threw together an
application, handed it in, and got the job.

# Python, Vim, Linux

I worked with Nao Suzuki, a post doc in the SCP. Weirdly, and lucky for me, he
had decided not to use [IDL][idl_is_bad], the standard language for
astrophyscis software, and instead wanted to work with Python. I picked up
Python quickly because I suddenly had a reason to use it. We used Numarray and
Numeric (which would later become Numpy).

My time with Nao was a formative experience. I learned Python, Linux and the
command line, and Vim. Maybe most importantly I learned that a computer could
be made to do what you told it to do, that its purpose was to solve your
problems, and if you knew the right language you make it do magic.
