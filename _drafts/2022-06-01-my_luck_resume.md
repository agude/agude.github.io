I am currently a staff-level machine learning engineer at a major tech
company.

8 years ago I was a PhD student unsure of what to do next.

18 years ago I was just starting college and knew I was going to be a
physicist.

# Coding

I started writing code on my Ti-83 in high school instead of doing math
class.I realized I could make the calculator do a lot of work for me and that
drew me in. Soon I was making text based GUIs and even (really bad) games like
"move the Ï€ symbol around the screen". I later took these skills and started
making really complicated Excel spread sheets for roleplaying games that would
track my character's power-level and progression and role dice for me.

When I got to college I tried to learn Java, but I had no motivation to use
it. There were no problems I was trying to solve.

# LBL

I realized in 2005 that I needed to get a summer research position if I wanted
to be a physicist (and I did). I didn't really know how to go about it though.
Luckily for me, my good friend from high school had an aunt how worked as an
executive assistant at Lawrence Berkeley Labs (LBL). My mom heard from my
friend's mom that [Saul Perlmutter's][saul] group, the [Supernova Cosmology
Project][scp] (SCP) was looking for undergraduates. I threw together an
application, handed it in, and got the job.

# Python, Vim, Linux

I worked with Nao Suzuki, a post doc in the SCP. Weirdly, and lucky for me, he
had decided not to use [IDL][idl_is_bad], the standard language for
astrophyscis software, and instead wanted to work with Python. I picked up
Python quickly because I suddenly had a reason to use it. We used Numarray and
Numeric (which would later become Numpy).

My time with Nao was formative. I learned Python, Linux and the command line,
and Vim. Most importantly I learned that a computer could be made to do what
you told it to do, that its purpose was to solve your problems, and if you
knew the right language you make it do magic.

# Data Science

As I neared the end of my PhD I realized I was not going to be a professor,
the odds were just too bad. I figured out my fallback would be moving back to
the Bay Area and getting a software engineering job, so I started taking
algorithm classes and practicing coding interviews.

Around this time I stumbled onto the blog of a former student instrcutor of
mine, [Jessica Kirkpatrick][jessica]. The top post was [_Career Profiles:
Astronomer to Data Scientist_][jess_post], which said:

I clicked the link to Insight Data Science. It said "Applications due in 2
days". I decided to apply, even with such limited time to put together an
application. It was accepted!
