As a new data scientist, my life was pretty easy: come in, work on one big
problem, go home. As I integrated with my team and company, I started taking
on new roles: mentor new hires, improve internal processes, attend planning
meetings and follow up, etc., etc., etc.

By the time I was running a team I no longer had one thing I was focusing on a
day, I had dozens. Often these things would only take a 15-30 minutes to do,
but I would have to fit them in with all my meetings. My strategy of "remember
what I need to do today" stopped working because I just had too much to
remember, with items added and removed constantly.

I needed a strategy; what I came up with was a version of [David
Allen's][allen] [Getting Things Done][gtd]. Here is how I do it.
