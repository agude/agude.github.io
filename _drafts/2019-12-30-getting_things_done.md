As a new data scientist, my life was pretty easy: come in, work on one big
problem, go home. As I integrated with my team and company, I started taking
on new roles: mentor new hires, improve internal processes, attend planning
meetings and follow up, and so on.

By the time I was running a team, I no longer had one thing I was focusing on
a day, I had dozens. Often these things would only take a 15-30 minutes to do,
but I would have to fit them in with all my meetings. My strategy of "remember
what I need to do today" stopped working because I just had too much to
remember, with items added and removed constantly.

I needed a strategy; what I came up with was a version of [David
Allen's][allen] [Getting Things Done][gtd]. Here is how I do it.

## Trello

The key insight of the Getting Things Done framework is that there should be
**one** place where tasks are recorded. I was storing tasks in my
notes---both the electronic and paper versions---in my email using the
"important" flag, and in my brain which meant I had to check multiple places
when I had time to knock out a task. I decided the one place to track tasks
would be [Trello][trello] because adding and arranging tasks is easy, it
supports my computer and phone, and has enough power-ups that I can customize my
workflow.

I set up six columns named as follows (yes, with the emoji):

- **üóÉÔ∏è Backlog**: Tasks which are not urgent or not ready to start; a lot of
"someday" tasks end up here.
- **üì• Inbox**: The landing place for new tasks whee I focus on quick entry on
not on correctness.r
- **‚òÄÔ∏è Do This Week**: Tasks to do this week.
- **üìÖ Do Today**: Tasks to do today.
- **‚úÖ Done**: Finished tasks.
- **üéì Learning**: Books, articles, and papers that I want to read, classes I
want to take, etc.

Every morning I triage my tasks by taking one of two actions:

1. If the task can be done in 5 minutes I do it right then.
2. If the task can't be completed quickly, I move it to the correct column and
   make sure all the meta data like title are filled in and descriptive.

Mostly triaging means moving tasks from the _Inbox_ and the _Backlog_ to one
of the _Do_ columns. On Monday I also make sure to take a moment to think
about my week and fill up the _Do This Week_ column. Everyday I think about
what I'm going to need to get done that day and move those tasks to the _Do
Today_ column.

When I have time to complete some tasks, I look at _Do Today_ and pick
something I can fit in, and do it. Then I move the task to _Done_.

## Capturing Tasks

A good friend told me that the key to this system was that "you can't block on
IO", meaning tasks have to be recorded as soon as you're aware of them and you
can't worry about filling all the metadata in right then. That's what triage
is for.

## Useful Power-Ups

I found two power-ups to be useful:

- **Card Repeater**: This power-up lets you schedule a card to reappear. I used it
for things like "schedule the weekly team meeting" and "fill out the project
status update" which had to happen on a fixed schedule. I _also_ used it for
things I wanted to get in the habit of doing, like "ask for feedback". To this
end I set three "ask for feedback" tasks appear on my board every Monday so I
could get in the habit of asking.
- **Card Aging**: This power-up faded cards that hadn't been touched for a
while. This let me see what tasks where being ignored and let me re-evaluate
if they were still worth doing.
