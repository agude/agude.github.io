I discovered data science as a possible career in 2014 when I was looking for
something to do after [deciding not to pursue a career in academia][phd]. Less
than a year later I was a professional data scientist,[^pro] having moved
across country and gotten a job with the help of [Insight][insight]. It was
there I realized that the data science role was splintering into multiple,
specialized roles.

[phd]: /blog/should-i-get-a-phd/#but-there-are-no-jobs
[insight]: {% post_url 2018-08-21-should_i_go_to_insight %}

At Insight there were two types of fellows: those who were most interested in
statistics and experiment design and those most interested in coding and
machine learning. We interviewed for the same roles because many companies
were just looking for "data scientists".[^unicorn] This wasted a lot of time
for us and for the companies as they interviewed people who did not want to do
specific job they were hiring for. The obvious solution was that these would
become different roles with different expected skills.


There are several reasons for the split:

- **There are no unicorns.** Data scientists who are experts in every part of
  the data ecosystem are not just rare, they are mythical. Everyone is better
  in some area than others. Splitting the data ecosystem into multiple,
  distinct roles allows people to work in the areas where they're strongest
  and most passionate.
- **Training a person to do it all takes too long.** In the beginning most
  data scientists had PhDs in some data-related field. They had each spent a
  decade learning math, statistics, coding, how to work with large datasets,
  how to structure an experiment, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But that
  process was and is too slow to meet the current demand for data scientists.
  A shorter, undergraduate major was required (and has since been adopted by
  almost every major college). Of course the best way to teach ten years worth
  of knowledge in four is to split it across three people. Splitting the job
  into multiple different ones allows people to be trained more quickly.

[^pro]: At least in the sense that I was paid to do it... I don't claim to
        have been any good.

[^unicorn]: In the **Unicorn Era** companies tried to hire people who spanned
    the entire spectrum of data jobs from setting up the basic infrastructure,
    to building analyses on top of it, and shipping and owning models into
    production. This full skill set was incredibly rare (hence, "unicorn"),
    but since there weren't a ton of data science jobs and the field was still
    ill defined, it worked OK.

    But the demand for data scientists exploded and the tasks they were asked
    to perform became more and more demanding. It no longer made sense to try
    to find one person to do it all. For one, you just could not hire enough
    people who were "unicorns". Instead the role was split into multiple
    different positions so that the work that had before been owned by
    individuals with ill defined titles instead was distributed across an
    entire teams. Hence, the **Team Era**.
