title: When Are Large Language Models Useful?
description: >
  OpenAI's ChatGPT is viewed as entertaining but not useful because it makes
  up facts. But I find it incredibly valuable for writing. Here is how I use
  it.

## What Are They Good For?

In math, there are a types of problems where finding a solution is difficult
or impossible, but verifying a solution is easy. A common strategy to solve
these problems is to guess the solution's form and then verify it, such as for
an integral where the solution can be verified by taking its derivative.

These problems---where generating the solution is hard but verifying it is
easy---are where large language models excel. Think of editing a paragraph. It
is hard to write down five different version, it would take me probably 2-3
minutes each and I'd be exhausted at the end. But I can read one of the
paragraphs in about 10 seconds and judge if it is good and correct. Editing is
hard but verifying the edit is easy, the perfect place to use an LLM!
