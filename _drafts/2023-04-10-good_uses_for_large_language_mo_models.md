title: When Are Large Language Models Useful?
description: >
  OpenAI's ChatGPT is viewed as entertaining but not useful because it makes
  up facts. But I find it incredibly valuable for writing. Here is how I use
  it.

## What Are They Good For?

In math there is a type of problem where it is hard (or impossible) to
generate a solution, but if given a solution it is easy to verify. For
example, it is hard to find the solution to an integral, but it is trivial to
take the derivative of the solution and confirm that it is correct. In these
situations a common strategy is to "guess" the form of the solution and then
verify that it is correct.

These problems---where generating the solution is hard but verifying it is
easy---are where large language models excel. Think of editing a paragraph. It
is hard to write down five different version, it would take me probably 2-3
minutes each and I'd be exhausted at the end. But I can read one of the
paragraphs in about 10 seconds and judge if it is good and correct. Editing is
hard but verifying the edit is easy, the perfect place to use an LLM!
