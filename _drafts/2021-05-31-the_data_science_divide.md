I discovered data science as a possible career in 2014 when I was looking for
something to do after [deciding not to pursue a career in academia][phd]. Less
than a year later I was a professional data scientist,[^pro] having moved
across country and gotten a job with the help of [Insight][insight]. It was
there that I realized that the data science role was already splintering into
multiple, specialized roles.

[^pro]: At least in the sense that I was paid to do it... I don't claim to
    have been any good.

## The Split

At Insight I ran into lots of different types of data scientists. Some were
really, really good at statistics; others lived for experiment design and
power analysis; some---like me---loved writing clean, performant code and
playing around with deep learning. Yet at the end of the program we mostly
interviewed for jobs that were no more specific than "data scientist". The
companies were looking for someone to set up their data teams and extract
value from their data.

This was the tail end of the unicorn era. Data engineering had already become
it's own specialty, but everything else was still under the umbrella term
data scientist. But even as a neophyte I could see further splits coming.

### Unicorn Era 💻🦄

The **Unicorn Era** was the time when data science was first being
established. Companies had heard that "data was the new oil" and were
desperate to hire someone to refine it for them. They looked to hire
someone who could span the entire spectrum of data jobs, from setting up the
infrastructure, to building analyses on top of it, to shipping and owning
models in production. But people who could master all of these skills were not
just rare, they were mythical. Hence, unicorns.

It worked OK for awhile. There were only a few data science jobs so companies
only need to find a scant handful of unicorns. Still it couldn't last. Demand
for data scientists exploded and the tasks they were asked to perform became
more and more demanding. It no longer made sense to try to find a single
person to do it all. 

First, finding unicorns had always been nearly impossible. Every data
scientist is an expert in some part of the field, but almost no one is great
at everything **and** interested in all of it. Splitting the role allows
people to focus on the areas that they were most passionate about.

Second, training a data scientist---waiting for them to finish a PhD in some
_other_ subject first while hoping the required data skills would rub off on
them in the process---took **too long**. An undergraduate degree was the
obvious solution and every college was spinning up a data science
undergraduate program at the time. But how could you impart the ten years of
knowledge gathered in the lead up to a PhD in just four? You can't--- unless
you split it across three different people.

### The Team Era 🧑🏾‍💻 🧑🏻‍💻 🧑🏿‍💻 🧑🏽‍💻 🧑🏼‍💻

So the role slow split into multiple different positions so that the work that
had before been owned by individuals with ill defined titles instead was
distributed across an entire teams. Hence, the **Team Era**.
