I discovered data science as a possible career in 2014 when I was looking for
something to do after [deciding not to pursue a career in academia][phd]. Less
than a year later I was a professional data scientist,[^pro] having moved
across country and gotten a job with the help of [Insight][insight]. It was
there that I realized that the data science role was already splintering into
multiple, specialized roles.

[^pro]: At least in the sense that I was paid to do it... I don't claim to
    have been any good.

# Unicorns to Teams

In the **Unicorn Era** companies tried to hire people who spanned the entire
spectrum of data jobs from setting up the basic infrastructure, to building
analyses on top of it, to shipping and owning models into production. This
full skill set was incredibly rare (hence, "unicorn"), but since there weren't
a ton of data science jobs and the field was still ill defined, it worked OK.

But the demand for data scientists exploded and the tasks they were asked to
perform became more and more demanding. It no longer made sense to try to find
one person to do it all. For one, you just could not hire enough people who
were "unicorns". Instead the role was split into multiple different positions
so that the work that had before been owned by individuals with ill defined
titles instead was distributed across an entire teams. Hence, the **Team
Era**.

## The Divide

At Insight people fell into two broad skill sets: those most interested in
statistics and experiment design and those most interested in coding and
machine learning. We interviewed for the same roles, possibly because the
companies were used to looking for unicorns that could do it all, even though
we would have preferred more specialized roles.

This wasted a lot of time for both us and the companies as they interviewed
people who did not fit the job and were interested in doing so. It was clear
that data science covered too many disparate skills and responsibilities to be
lumped into one job title, which meant is would inevitably split into
multiple, distinct roles.

The split made sense for many reasons:

- **There are no unicorns.** Data scientists who are experts in every part of
  the data ecosystem are not just rare, they are mythical. Everyone has
  strengths and weaknesses. By splitting the role, people could focus on the
  part they were most passionate about.
- **Training a person to do it all takes too long.** In the beginning, most
  data scientists had PhDs in some data-related field. They each spent a
  decade learning math, statistics, coding, how to work with large datasets,
  how to structure an experiment, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But that
  process was and is too slow to meet the current demand for data scientists.
  A shorter, undergraduate major was required (and has since been adopted by
  almost every major college). Of course the best way to teach ten years worth
  of knowledge in four is to split it across three people. Splitting the job
  into multiple different ones allows people to be trained more quickly.
