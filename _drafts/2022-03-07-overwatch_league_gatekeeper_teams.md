A **gatekeeper** is a team that beats lower ranked teams, often in a lopsided
fashion, but loses to teams ranked higher than it. Gatekeepers are frustrating
for their fans because the look so good against bad teams but can't climb out
of the [midtable][mid].

[mid]: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/midtable

The **gatekeeper score** is the win percentage against teams that finished
lower in the regular season standings minus the win percentage against teams
that finished higher in the standings. A perfect gatekeeper team, one that
beats all lower ranked teams but loses to all the teams above them, would have
a gatekeeper score of 100 (100% win rate against lower teams minus 0% win rate
against high teams).

On final note on this score: the team _must gatekeep someone_ to be a
gatekeeper. A team that wins no matches, like the [2018 Shanghai
Dragons][2018_dragons], loses to everyone ranked above them, but did not beat
anyone, so aren't a gatekeeper. Their score is undefined because they have no
win rate against lower ranked teams. The same applies for the top team in the
league: no one is ranked above them so their win rate against better teams is
undefined.
