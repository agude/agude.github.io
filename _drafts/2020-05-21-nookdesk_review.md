I bought a standing desk recently since I am working from home three days a
week.[^1] There were many desks that I considered, but I finally bought a
[Nookdesk][nookdesk]. It was not an easy decision because I could only find
[one **real** review online][review]; all the others were press releases
rewritten on a short deadline.

Luckily I had a good friend who had just bought one. She was happy with her
Nookdesk and I bought mine on the strength of her recommendation. In short,
I am also happy with it. For more details, read on.

## Nookdesk Options and Accessories

### Desktop
The [Nookdesk][nookdesk] has a lot of options for customization. The desktops
are offered in multiple materials:

- Laminate (Base)
- Wood Laminate (+$100)
- Plantation Oak (+$200)
- Bamboo (+$350)

The desk surface is always 30″ deep with widths from 48″ to 72″. The desk
frame comes in three colors: white, black, and grey.

I chose a 30″ by 72″(+$200) blackwood laminate (+$100) desktop with white
frame. The desktop is 3/4 inch thick. The wood laminate feels great; smooth
with just a bit of depth from the grain. The white frame contrasts nicely with
the black desktop.

### Storage

The Nookdesk has some unique storage options. The first is the "upper storage"
addon which I would describe as a shelf. It is mounted on the top of the desk
at the back edge. It is 12″ deep and raised 4″ off desktop. I store my
controller and headphones under the shelf and I put my monitors on top to
bring them up to eye-level. The upper storage addon cost $100, but was well
worth it.

There is a similar "lower storage" shelf that mounts under the desk at the
front edge. I did not order one because I like to have my desk surface very
close to my knees in the sitting position, and the lower storage would add 4″
to the bottom of the desk. It also costs $100.

The ability to add some storage to my desk, and raise my monitors at the same
time, was what sold me on the desk as compared to its competitors.

### Accessories

Nookdesk offers a wide variety of accessories, from keyboard trays to
speakers. Below I list only the ones I purchased.

The Nookdesk comes with one of two controllers: a simple one which just has up
and down buttons and a programmable one with three memory settings for an
additional $34. I got the programmable controller because getting my desk to
exactly the right height each time was important for me. In the end I only
really needed two memory positions: one for standing and one for sitting. I
still have not assigned the third position.

Nookdesk sells a Freeport power strip that attaches to the
underside of the desk for $80. It has 8 outlets (including 2 with space around
them for those extra-large plugs) and 4 USB-A outlets, 3 of which provide up
2.4A and one which supports [Quick Charge 3.0][qc]. It has a 10 foot cord. You
can plug the desk's motor 1 of the 8 outlets so that you only have to plug in
the Freeport to the wall. I bought the Freeport and I am ratified with it, but
I suspect it could have found a cheaper power strip to mount.

Nookdesk also sells an under-desk CPU mount. It will fit towers up to 9.25″
wide and 30″ tall, although if the desk it fully lowered it only have 20″ of
clearance for the tower. The holder costs $100, but I love mine. It is one of
my favorite features of the desk. It keeps my computer off the ground, frees
up space on my desktop, and makes it so I do not have to get very long cords
to all the desk to rise while leaving the computer stationary on the floor.

Finally I bought the cable management tray. It is a metal try that runs along
the bottom of the desk at the rear edge and allows you to tuck your cables
into it to keep them tidy. It costs $100.
