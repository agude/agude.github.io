The [gender pay gap][pay_gap] is a contentious issue, especially in tech where
[women are historical excluded][women_in_tech]. Others have looked into the
same question before: [Florian Lindstaedt][florian] used a much larger (but
less clean) dataset from Kaggle to [look at the issue on his
blog][kaggle_survey]. He found that for data scientists younger than 30, women
earned slightly more, but in the 30-35 age group men earned more.

I can look at the pay gap in Data Science using the same [Insight][insight]
alumni survey I used [last time][last_time]. This data has some biases, in
that it is collected from Insight alumni who are mostly:

[insight]: https://www.insightdatascience.com
[last_time]: {% post_url 2019-03-26-data_science_salaries %} 

- PhDs
- Early career
- In high-demand markets
- Coached on salary negotiation

The gender question was only added to the survey later, so around a third of
the data does not have that information. This leaves us 79 men and 28 women.
Not a huge sample, but better than nothing.

Of course, this low number of woman might itself be a further bias: Insight
generally has pretty gender-balanced cohorts, so that fact the many fewer
women have filled out the survey is worrying. It is possible that non-response
is not random and instead is correlated to the underlying distribution, for
example, perhaps people who are paid less refuse to report.

The data used in this post is available [here][data]. The notebook with all
the code is [here][notebook] ([rendered on Github][rendered]).

## Gendered Pay

First, I'll look at total recurring compensation by gender. I have removed all
the non-data scientists (like the [MLEs I looked at last time][last_time_mle]
because I have very few responses from them. I have also removed the one data
scientist who marked themselves as "transgender" without indicating their
gender identity further.

So, how is pay equality in data science?

Pretty equal, actually! The median woman in the sample earns more then the
median man, but of course the number of samples is really small.

| Gender  |  Median Total Compensation|
|:--------|--------------------------:|
| Female  |                     $149k |
| Male    |                     $139k |

There are lots of things I would like to explore---like "do women benifit from
seniority the same as men?", like [I observed last
time][last_time_senior]---but I just do not have enough women in the sample to
say anything conclusive.
