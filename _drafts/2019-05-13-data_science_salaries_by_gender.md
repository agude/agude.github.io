The [gender pay gap][pay_gap] is a contentious issue, especially in tech where
[women are historical excluded][women_in_tech]. I have some data to look at
the pay gap in Data Science, using the same [Insight][insight] alumni survey I
used [last time][last_time].

[insight]: https://www.insightdatascience.com

This data has some biases, in that it is collected from Insight
alumni who are, mostly:

- PhDs
- Early career
- In high-demand markets
- Coached on salary negotiation

Additionally, gender was not on the original survey and only added later, so
around a third of the data does not have that information. With those
limitations noted, I'll move on.

The data is available [here][data]. The notebook with all the code is
[here][notebook] ([rendered on Github][rendered]).

## Gendered Pay

Here are all the data scientists in the dataset, divided by gender. I have
removed all the non-data scientists (like the [MLEs I looked at last
time][last_time_mle] because I have very few responses from them. I have also
removed the one data scientist who marked themselves as "transgender" without
indicating their gender identity further.

So, how is pay equality in data science?

Pretty equal, actually! The median woman in the sample earns more then the
median man, but of course the number of samples is really small.

| Gender  |  Median Total Compensation|
|:--------|--------------------------:|
| Female  |                     $149k |
| Male    |                     $139k |

At this point I will note a further bias in the data: there are far fewer
women than men, even though Insight generally has pretty balanced cohorts. It
is possible that non-response is not random and instead is correlated to the
underlying distribution, for example, perhaps people who are paid less refuse
to report.

There are lots of things I would like to explore---like if women and men see
the same [effects from seniority that I observed last
time][last_time_senior]---but I just do not have enough women in the sample to
say anything conclusive.
