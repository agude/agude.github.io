## Manager Vs IC

Most tech companies have two tracks for engineers and data scientists: a
manager track and an individual contributer (IC) track. The intent is that a
technical person should be able to advance their career without switching to
managing people---an entirely different skill set and job. While this is true,
you can continue to be promoted without going into management, there are some
trade offs.

### The Structure of the tracks

Every company is slightly different, but most of them have their two tracks
set up something like this:

```text
L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 → L5 → L6 ...
              ↳ M4 → M5 → M6 ...
```

The only role open to the most junior engineers are IC roles (prefixed with L
in the chart), which makes sense: they lack the hard-earned experience
companies want an engineering manager to have. As junior engineers get
promoted they move from L1 to L2 and so on until at some point they reach a
level (L4 in my cartoon example above) where they can move onto the management
track (prefixed with M). Of course not ever IC gets this opportunity.

These tracks narrow as they go up. There are a generally a lot more L1, L2,
and L3 engineers than L4. Likewise there are more M4 engineering managers than
M5 managers or M6 managers (who at that point might have a title like
"director"). M4 managers run a team of IC. Managers at M5 or above run
teams of teams consisting of some IC and some subordinate managers running
their own teams.

High level IC on the other hand won't have people who report to them. Instead
they provide value by tackling harder problems and using soft power to
influence technical decisions in the organization. For more on their role,
see: TODO High level IC roles

A lot has been written about what it means to be an IC or a manager, how to
decide on the tracks, etc. 

## The Pyramid and the Spire

While both tracks narrow as they go up---that is there are more people at the
lower levels than the higher levels---their shape is different. The IC track
starts out broad, with possibly thousands or even tens of thousands of
engineers. But it narrows very quickly. In my last company there were
thousands of engineers, but only a single L8 in the entire company. There were
no L9s.
