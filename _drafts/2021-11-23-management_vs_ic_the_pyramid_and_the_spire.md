## Manager Vs IC

Most tech companies have two tracks for engineers and data scientists: a
manager track and an individual contributer (IC) track. The intent is that a
technical person should be able to advance their career without switching to
managing people---an entirely different skill set and job. While this is true,
you can continue to be promoted without going into management, there are some
trade offs.

### The Structure of the tracks

Every company is slightly different, but most of them have their two tracks
set up something like this:

```text
L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 → L5 → L6 ...
              ↳ M4 → M5 → M6 ...
```

The only role open to the most junior engineers are IC roles, which makes
sense: they lack the hard-earned experience you want an engineering manager to
have. As junior engineers get promoted they move from L1 to L2 and so on until
at some point they reach a level (L4 in my cartoon example above) where they
can move onto the management track. Of course not ever IC gets this
opportunity.

These tracks narrow as they go up. There are a generally a lot more L1, L2,
and L3 engineers than L4 (although sometimes there are only a few at a lower
level, some companies prefer to only hire experienced ICs). Likewise there are
more M4 engineering managers than M5 senior managers or M6 Directors (or
whatever the particular company calls their management levels).


There are more roles at the bottom of each track than the top, but the manager
track narrows more slowly.
