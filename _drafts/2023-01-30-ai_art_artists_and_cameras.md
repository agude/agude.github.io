The open-source release of [Stable Diffusion][sd] has sparked an explosion of
progress in AI-generated art. It is in its infancy, but I can already tell
this new artistic tool is going to revolutionize visual art creation. But not
everyone views AI art generation in a positive light. Many artists feel that
[AI art stole their work][stolen][^stolen_quote] and have [organized
protests][anti] on popular sites like _ArtStation_. Other artists [claim that
AI-generated art can't be art][not_art][^not_art_quote] because it isn't
human.

## AI and Photography as Art

I come down on the side of AI-artists.

This is probably unsurprising because I am a machine learning engineer, it is
my job to build the types of systems these artists are using. But what is less
obvious is that my support is also because I am an artist, specifically a
landscape photographer.

Photography has [a complicated history as "art"][jstor]. Although the first
photograph was taken in 1826, it wasn't until 1924 that an American museum
recognized the medium as art by [including photographs in its permanent
collection][as]. At fist artists feared photography would replace traditional
visual arts due to the ease of taking a picture. But eventually they realized
it was a useful tool that could be combined with other art forms, even if they
did not recognize photography as an art in its own
right.[^brush_and_pencil][^the_new_path]

## My Family's Art

My family has a long history of painting. My great-great-great grandfather was
the Norwegian landscape painter [Hans Gude][hans_gude]. My father, also named
[Hans Gude][hans_gude_2], was [an accomplished oil
painter][painter].[^hans_art] I too wanted to make art, but I did not have
their skill with a brush so I picked up a camera and lens instead.

[^hans_art]:
    My father somewhat rejected the title of "artist", although in later life
    he branded himself as such. He prefered to think of himself as a
    craftsman, honing his skills through hardwork and study.

I was drawn to photography **specifically because** it used technology. I like
learning new technologies and how to master them. I _also_ thought it would be
easier to learn to make art I was happy using a camera. I have since learned
that photography has its own set of skills to master, but after 15 years I
think I was mostly right: it is much easier than oil painting.

I wonder what my great grandfather would have think of my art. He spent months
or years creating his seascapes, while my photographs are captured in a
fraction of a second with the push of a button, and maybe a few hours later
spend adjusting tone curve and highlights.

But I like to think that he would view my work as a continuation of our
family's artistic tradition. Maybe in the future, my descendants will find the
camera too complicated and instead compose prompts for AI to translate into
images. To me, that's simply another evolution of the art form.
