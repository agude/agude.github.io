title: "SWITRS: Accidents After Daylight Saving Time Ends"
description: >
  Day light saving time leaves leads to more traffic accidents, but what about
  when DST ends? Some researchers have found that it does lead to more
  accidents, so I take a look using California's SWITRS data.

We all hate the change to [daylight saving time][dst] (DST) in the spring; it
makes us tired, grumpy, but worst of all it [causes us to crash our cars at a
higher rate][dst_article]! The end of DST is not as universally reviled,
probably because we get back the hour of sleep we lost earlier in the year, but [Varughese &
Allen][varughese] found that there was still a "significant increase in number of
accidents on the Sunday of the fall shift from DST".[^1]

With the [SWIRTS data][s2s_post] that I collected, and the analysis code I
developed for [my post last year looking at car accidents after the DST
change][dst_article], it should be pretty easy to check if I see the same
trend as Varughese & Allen.

The Jupyter notebook used to perform this analysis can be found
[here][notebook] ([rendered on Github][rendered]).

## Accident Ratio

Just like [last time][dst_ar], I will look at the number of accidents on the
days following the end of DST. In order to help cancel out effects other than
the time change---like the fact that [accident rates vary by 30% depending on
the year][apw]---I will divide each day's total by the number of accidents a
week later, when people are presumably back to normal. 

[apw]: {% post_url 2016-12-02-switrs_crashes_by_date %}#accidents-per-week
[dst_ar]: {% post_url 2017-03-20-switrs_daylight_saving_time_accidents %}#accident-ratio

Unlike last time, I am not normalizing by the number of accidents two weeks
after the change. The reason for this is simple: that's Thanksgiving week, and
[as I showed before][thanksgiving] the number of accidents is greatly reduced
during the holidays.

Just as last time, the [violin plots][violin] below show the distribution of
these ratios from the years 2001 to 2017. A value greater than 1 means that
there are more accidents during the week when DST starts than two weeks after.

after the start of daylight saving time, divided by the week two weeks
after.][ratio_plot]][ratio_plot]

There is, on average, a larger number of crashes on Sunday when the time
changes as seen by Varughese & Allen. However, the same excess is not seen
when a different normalization is chosen, like using the [week
before][before_plot] or [two weeks after][after_plot].[^2] The week before has
different lighting during commute times and so it is easier to dismiss, but
two weeks after has similar lighting.

## _t_-Test

Instead, we turn away from our "_chi-by-eye_" test and do an actual
statistical test: a [_two-tailed paired t-test_][paired_t-test], the same test
used by Varughese & Allen. They find a significant (_p_ < 0.002) increase in
the number of deadly accidents on the Sunday that DST ends, but I do not (_p_
= 0.082).

Our methods are different in a few key ways: 

- They look only at fatal accidents while I look at all.
- They compare to the mean of the week before and after while I use only the week after.

If I reproduce their methods with my dataset, I still do not find a
significant result (_p_ = 0.158).

As for California, [Kansen Chu][chu] has once again given us a chance to get
rid of the time change with [Prop 7][prop7]. His [earlier bill
failed][ab-385], so he has gone directly to the voters this time. I, for one,
am voting yes!
