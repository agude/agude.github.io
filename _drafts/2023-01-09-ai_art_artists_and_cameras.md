The open-source release of [Stable Diffusion][sd] has sparked and explosion of
progress in AI-generated art. Before our eyes a new artistic medium and tool
are being invented. But not everyone views it in a positive light. Many
artists feel that [AI art stole their work][stolen][^stolen_quote] and have
[organized protests][anti] on popular sites like _ArtStation_. Other artists
[claim that AI-generated art can't be art][not_art].[^not_art_quote]

AI art and the debate around it fascinates me for two reasons:

1. I am a Machine learning engineer; my job is to build systems like the ones
   generating these pieces of art.
2. I am an artist, specifically a landscape photographer, and I come from a
   long line of artists.

My great-great-great grandfather was the Norwegian landscape painter [Hans
Gude][hans_gude] and my father, also named [Hans Gude][hans_gude_2], was [an
accomplished oil painter][painter].[^hans_art] I don't have their skill with a
brush but I still longed to make art, so I picked up a camera.

[^hans_art]:
    My father somewhat rejected the title of "artist", although in later life
    he branded himself as such. He prefered to think of himself as a
    craftsman, honing his skills through hardwork and study.

Photography appealed to me **specifically because** it used technology. I
like learning new technologies and how to master them. I _also_ thought it
would be easier to learn to make art I was happy with with a camera than with
oil paints. Although I learned that photography has its own skills to master,
after 15 years I think I was right: it is much easier than oil painting.

I think that's why I feel some kinship with these prompt engineers. 


Regardless I think AI is here to stay. It is too useful a tool. So I like to
think about it from a tool perspective and for that I like to think about how
my art form came to be.

I wonder what my great grandfather would have thought of my art. Compared to
his seascapes which could take months or years to execute, my photos take a
fraction of a second to push a button and then maybe a few hours adjusting
highlights and tone curves. But while I don't have their level of skill, I
like to think that my landscape photography at least follows in my family's
artistic footsteps.
