The recent explosion in the progress of AI-generated art, sparked by the
open-source release of [Stable Diffusion][sd], has been breathtaking to
witness. Before our eyes a new artistic medium and tool are being invented.
But not everyone views it in a positive light. Many artists feel that [AI art
stole their work to train on][stolen][^stolen_quote].

Others are [organizing 
protests][anti] on popular websites like _ArtStation_

AI art and the debate around it fascinates me for two reasons:

1. Machine learning is my job, so I am excited to see the field advance.
2. I am an artist, and I come from a long line of artists.

My great-great-great grandfather was the Norwegian landscape painter [Hans
Gude][hans_gude] and my father, also named [Hans Gude][hans_gude_2], was [an
accomplished oil painter][painter]. I don't have their skill with a brush but
I still longed to make art, so I picked up a camera.

Photography appealed to me **specifically because** it used technology. I
like learning new technologies and how to master them. I _also_ thought it
would be easier to learn to make art I was happy with with a camera than with
oil paints and although I learned that photography has its own skills to
master, after 15 years I think I was right.

Regardless I think AI is here to stay. It is too useful a tool. So I like to
think about it from a tool perspective and for that I like to think about how
my art form came to be.

I wonder what my great grandfather would have thought of my art. Compared to
his seascapes which could take months or years to execute, my photos take a
fraction of a second to push a button and then maybe a few hours adjusting
highlights and tone curves. But while I don't have their level of skill, I
like to think that my landscape photography at least follows in my family's
artistic footsteps.
