The recent explosion in the progress of AI-generated art, sparked by the
open-source release of [Stable Diffusion][sd], has been breathtaking to
witness. Before our eyes a new artistic tool and medium are arising. But not
everyone views it in a positive light. Many artists feel that [AI art stole
their work to train on][stolen][^stolen_quote] and they have [organized
protests][anti] on popular websites like _ArtStation_.

Regardless I think AI is here to stay. It is too useful a tool. So I like to
think about it from a tool perspective and for that I like to think about how
my art form came to be.

I am fascinated by AI art fascinates for two reasons. The first is probably
obvious: I work in machine learning and so I am of course interested in the
rapid development of the methods I use. But the second is less so: I am an
artist, and I come from a long line of artists. My great-great-great
grandfather was the Norwegian landscape painter [Hans Gude][hans_gude] and my
father, also named [Hans Gude][hans_gude_2], was [an accomplished oil
painter][painter]. I am a landscape photographer (and sometime reluctant
wedding photographer).

I wonder what my great grandfather would have thought of my art. Compared to
his seascapes which could take months or years to execute, my photos take a
fraction of a second to push a button and then maybe a few hours adjusting
highlights and tone curves. But while I don't have their level of skill, I
like to think that my landscape photography at least follows in my family's
artistic footsteps.
