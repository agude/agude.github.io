My wife and I bought a RadWagon 3, an inexpensive electric cargo bike made by
[Rad Power Bikes][rpb], right before the pandemic hit in early 2020. We wanted
to try out a cheap cargo bike since we weren't sure it would fit our
lifestyle.

We've now put 1850 miles on the bike, mostly hauling kids to local parks.
After all the time spent with it, would we recommend it to another family?

In short: we **love the utility an electric cargo bike offers**, and I think
we will always have one in the garage to supplement our minivan, **but the
RadWagon has some significant draw backs** that make recommending it
difficult. Read on for the full review.

## The Bike

The Rad Wagon itself was $1500. With a "caboose" enclosure and pads
for the kids adding $250, plus tax, our total was $1901---not cheap, but
almost a third of comparable cargo bikes.

### Assembly and Adjustment

The bike comes in a box and you must assemble it yourself. Even without much
experience, assembly should be manageable, though some experience with bikes
helps. As an avid cyclist, I found it simple.

The seat post and headset are highly adjustable, allowing people of varying
heights to ride it. It works for my wife who is 5'4" and me who is 6'1".

### Motor

The bike uses a rear hub motor. It has a throttle, which I love for
getting started from a stop, and enough power to carry me, two kids, and some
balance bikes up a steep hill. The downside though is the hub motor puts a lot
of street on the rear wheel.

### Flaws

A flaw is the rear brake. The motor blocks the typical through-spoke access for
adjusting it. Instead, Rad makes a special flat Allen wrench that fits between
the brake and motor but adjusting remains hard.

A major flaw is the rear spokes. They are stressed by both the motor---which
puts all its power through the rear wheel---and the cargo and they were not
tight enough from the factory. I broke several in the first 200 miles. It has
improved after replacing and retightening, but I still break one periodically,
which is annoying for me and likely a dealbreaker for less experienced riders.

## Support

I've contacted Rad's support several times---to order spokes, the brake tool,
and replace a faulty accessory. They were generally quick and helpful but I've
never needed support for other bikes. And the last interaction was terrible:
their front basket was defective and instead of helping out Rad support
accused me of being unable to use a screw driver and then stopped responding.

## Final Thoughts

The RadWagon was a savior during the pandemic, letting us escape the house and
ride when we'd otherwise be trapped inside. It also beats driving kids in a
car---hauling them on the back makes getting to the park part of the fun.

But the bike needs constant maintenance that is difficult even for experienced
mechanic, and Rad's support is not great. I wish I had purchased a
higher-quality bike that wouldn't fail so frequently.
