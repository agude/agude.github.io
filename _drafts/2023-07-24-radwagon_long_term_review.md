We bought a RadWagon 3, an inexpensive electric cargo bike made by [Rad Power
Bikes][rpb], right before the pandemic hit in early 2020. We wanted to try a
cheap cargo bike since we weren't sure it would fit our lifestyle. The Rad
Wagon itself was $1500. With a "caboose" enclosure and pads for the kids
adding $250, plus tax, our total was $1901---not cheap, but almost a third of
comparable cargo bikes.

In the past three years we've ridden our RadWagon 1900 miles on the bike,
mostly hauling kids to local parks. After all the time spent with it, would we
recommend it to another family?

In short: we love the utility an electric cargo bike offers, and I think we
will always have one in the garage to supplement our minivan, but the RadWagon
has some significant draw backs that make recommending it difficult. Read on
for the full review.
