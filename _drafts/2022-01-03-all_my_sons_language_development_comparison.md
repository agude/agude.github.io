I tracked the language development of all three of my sons. I wrote [a post
focusing on Theo's language development][theo_post], [another post focusing
on Cory's language development][cory_post], and [a final one focusing on Ash's
language development][ash_post]. In this post I'll compare them all.

## The Data

The data was collected by my wife and I using a Google form on our phones.
When we heard a new word we would log it. I then normalized the words
(sometimes we would write down Grandma and sometimes grandmother, for example)
by hand and took the first occurrence of each word in each language as the date
when they learned it.

I discuss data collection in more depth in [Theo's][theo_post_data], 
[Cory's][cory_post_data], and [Ash's][ash_post_data] data sections. You can
find the Jupyter notebook used to perform this analysis [here][notebook]
([rendered on Github][rendered]). The data can be found [here][theo_data], 
[here][cory_data], and [here][ash_data].

## Development

Below I have plotted the number of words each of my sons knew as a function of
their age. Theo, our first son, is represented by dotted lines; Cory, our
second son, is represented by dashed lines; Ash, our third son, is represented
with solid lines.

Cory learned all languages much faster than his brothers. Theo was the slowest
on English and Chinese, the primary languages of our household, but slightly
faster than Ash on Spanish, Sign, and Animal Sounds. Interestingly, Ash's
Chinese started strong but has slowed; had we kept recording I suspect Theo
would have caught up and passed him at 26 months of age.

I discuss the slow Chinese acquisition in the [development
section of Ash's post][ash_dev], but briefly I think it is related to me
working from home during the COVID pandemic. This meant that:

[ash_dev]: {% post_url 2021-12-20-my_third_sons_words %}#development

- We used a lot more English at home.
- I was able to better identify when he had learned new English words but not
  new Chinese words, which led to a selection effect in what was recorded.

Interestingly my wife tells me that Cory's current Chinese is worse than
Theo's was at the same age. Perhaps Cory's development slowed or there is more
to proficiency than just number of words known.

The shape of the English curves are all very similar, just displaced in time.
I would guess this has to do with the fact that they are always surrounded by
English speakers to learn from whereas the other languages require special
interactions with their family to learn.

Ash's Spanish has taken off much slower, although in comparison he is not too
far behind Theo. Theo's long drought of words is due to an injury my mom
sustained that prevented them from watching Theo and so reduced his contact
with Spanish. Ash doesn't have the same excuse, but it does show it's not too
late for him to pick it up.

Ash never got much into sign language. He learned pointing quickly and got by
just doing that until he could speak. We also didn't emphasize it as much
because we were very busy with our other two boys. I suspect this is why he
didn't know as many animal sounds as well: I used to sit with Theo and Cory
and point at animals in books and teach them but I did not do this with Ash.
