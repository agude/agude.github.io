Last time I wrote about [when pedestrians are hit by cars][last_post]. I
discovered that [Halloween is the day with _the most_ pedestrian
incidents][last_post_dbd], and that [the commute times][last_post_hbh] are
when most pedestrians are hit. Now I'll dive a little deeper into those
patterns using the same [SWITRS data][switrs].
