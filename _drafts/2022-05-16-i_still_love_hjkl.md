  A lot of Vim users think you grow out of using hjkl for movement. After 17

I learned VIM in 2005 when I got my first job at Lawrence Berkeley Lab. It was
a formative experience; the post doc I worked with was a bit of an iconoclast
and instead of using [IDL][idl_is_bad] list a good astrophysicist he wanted to
use Python.

I needed to become comfortable working on the command line, which included
editing text files and scripts, so my mentor recommended the text editor he
used: [Vim][vim]. It has been my primary editor ever since.[^neovim]

[^neovim]: At least until 2015, when I switched to [Neovim][neovim]. Neovim is
a fork of Vim with the goal of creating a modern open source project that is
easy to contribute to, easy to maintain, and extend, all while adding new
features and making the editor an embeddable library.
