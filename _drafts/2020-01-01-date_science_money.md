I didn't become a physicist for money. I remember walking across Sproul Plaza
with my father on our way to our favorite lunch place one day when I told him
something like "One of the things I love about [Cosmology][cosmology] is how
few applications there are! It's amazing that someone will pay me just to
expand human knowledge!" The words aren't exact---it has been well over a
decade since I said them---but the sentiment is.

The first time I visited [CERN][cern] during [my PhD][phd] I got an almost
ascetic feeling from looking at the dilapidated buildings and missing
shutters; here was a place that lived the scientific ethic I aspired to, a
place where peeling paint was ignored in favor of pursuing a higher calling.

I didn't [leave academia][leaving] for money either. I left for certainty. I
didn't want to drag my family around the globe for a 95% chance of being right
back where I started after several post docs. So after getting my PhD I drove
back to California to become a data scientist.

## Weighing The Offers Compensation

In California, I got to see my family far more than I had while working on my
PhD.

I attended Insight Data Science, where I learned how to sell myself as a data
scientist, and got a couple of job offers. As someone who had never really
been driven by money, I had never thought about how to compare the
compensation in the offers. It should be easy, right? Just pick the larger
number?

Insight brought data scientists, startup founders, and tech company executives
to educate us naive scientists in the ways of money. I learned more about
salary, bonuses, and equity than I ever thought I would.

There is base salary, the amount you get paid per year to work some place, but
total compensation consisted of much more. Many places paid yearly bonuses
based on your performance. All my offers had 15-20% yearly bonuses, but I
heard from some of the data scientists in finance that they would be upset if
their bonuses were not "integer multiples of their salary".[^1]

Equity was more complicated. 
Equity was covered as well, from how much to expect at a startup (1%-ish
if you're one of the earliest hires, less if you're later) and to dilution of
your shares (as the company sells parts of itself you lose ownership
percentage) and liquidation preferences (if you aren't one of the investors,
likely you're getting chached out last). For large companies they covered
stock options, [RSUs][rsu]

[rsu]: 


But it was not so simple. There were a lot of _"intangibles"_ like culture
fit, who my coworkers would be, and the work I would do. These were hard to
weight, but I knew they were incredibly important.

And biggest number? Also not easy. There was base salary, of course--the
ammount they would pay me per year. But also a yearly bonuses, dependent on
performance. And equity grants the vested over several years.

And those were just the most straightforward numbers! Much harder to compare
was the health plans (worth thousands of dollars a year, and perhaps your
life), retirement plans, and vacation allotements (and what does unlimited
vacation mean anyway?).

## Negotiating

Insight conditioned me that regardless of the offer I decided to accept, I had
to negotiate it.
