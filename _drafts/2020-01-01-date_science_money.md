I didn't become a physicist for money, quite the opposite in fact. I remember
walking across Sproul Plaza with my father on our way to our favorite lunch
place when I told him "I love that [Cosmology][cosmology] has so few practical
applications! It's amazing that someone will pay me just to expand human
knowledge!" Perhaps that should have been my first hint that Physics did not
have great long-term prospects, but I don't think that would have changed my
decision to pursue it.

The first time I visited [CERN][cern] during [my PhD][phd] I got an ascetic
feeling from looking at the dilapidated buildings and missing storm shutters.
It's exterior reflected the same feeling I had expressed to my father a few
years earlier, that pursuing science was worth more than dollars. I felt
instantly at home.

Years later, I didn't [leave academia][leaving] for money either; I left for
certainty. I wasn't going to drag my family around the globe just to end up
six years older and once again looking for a job. I had seen what the academic
job market was like by watching the people around me at CERN try and
universally fail to land a tenure track job. So I decided to head back to
where I was from---the Bay Area--and see what if I could make it as a data
scientist with the help of the Insight program.

## Compensation

As someone who had never been motivated by money, as I looked for a job I
discovered I was a little naive as to what all the numbers meant. Fortunately,
Insight anticipated this and brought data scientists, startup founders, and
tech company executives to educate us naive scientists in the ways of money. I
learned more about salary, bonuses, and equity than I ever thought I would.

I knew **base salary**: what you're paid in semi-weekly paychecks to do the
job. It's what I thought of when I heard "This job pays $120k a year". But
salary isn't everything for data scientists, we get multiple other forms of
compensation.

Every offer I received paid a **yearly bonus** of 15-20% based on your
performance. Those were for data science and machine learning positions in
pretty normal tech companies, but I heard from some of the data scientists in
finance and investing that they would be upset if their bonuses were not
"integer multiples of their salary".[^1]

Finally, Insight spent a lot of time teaching us about **equity**: owning a
piece of the company you're working in. For [publicly traded
companies][public], my offers were pretty simple: I would get a certain amount
of [RSUs][rsu] vest over the next three or four years at which point I could
sell them on the stock market (or hold them).[^2]

[public]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company
[rsu]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_stock

Startups were more complicated. I didn't get any offers from startups, but
this is what I learned from Insight and from working with VCs for two years:
particularly valuable early hires can receive up to a few percent ownership of
the startup, but that overtime that share would ["delute"][delution] as new
stock was issued. Complicated vesting structures could mean even with a good
exit, you shares might not not be worth what you thought if you're far down
the [liquidation preference][lp] stack.

[delution]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_dilution
[lp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation_preference

After all the preparation and thinking about compensation, I had two offers
to consider. But, how to choose? Just pick the biggest number, right? Turns
out it isn't so simple. There are a lot of _intangibles_ like "what work would
you be doing" and "who would you work with" that matter a lot, probably more
than money. I decided to go with the offer that had a bunch of great people on
the team and a very interesting problem, even though the total compensation
was lower.

## Negotiating

Once I had decided on an offer, I entered the most stressful part. Insight had
conditioned me that regardless of the offer I decided to accept, I had to
negotiate it. I spent a few days talking to my friends and family about the
offer trying to work up the courage to call the hiring manager. In the end I
took a deep breath and wrote a quick email:

> Hi!
>
> I'm very excited by your offer and the thought of working with the team, but
> I have another for $15,000 more. Can you increase yours? If so, I'll sign
> today.
>
> Alex

They wrote back a few hours later having increased the offer by $7,500 and I
signed immediately. A five minute email got earned me $18,000 over two years
in increased salary and bonus. A pretty good return on investment for a few
minutes of stress.

Two years later I got an amazing offer from my current company, far higher
than I'd said I was looking for in the interview. I knew I had made a slight
error giving the first number, and in the back of my mind I could hear my
Insight advisor telling me to negotiate.

I talked to the VCs I worked with for a few days to work up the courage. They
all thought negotiating was the correct thing to do (they were right), even
saying "look, in my job if I didn't negotiate my offer they'd consider it a
bad sign". Data science is a little different than investing, but the advice
is solid: as a hiring manager I've never once cared that someone negotiated,
I'm just excited to close on a candidate.

So this time I wrote an email asking for a lot and got a reply back asking
for a phone call. I laid out my rationale, that my friends with similar
experience were getting those sort of offers. They kept me sweating for a few
days, but finally returned an offer with $5,000 higher base comp and $50,000
more in RSUs. It was a lot more stressful than my first negotiating, but again
the return on investment was huge!

[^2]: I generally sell my RSUs immediately; I already have my salary and health insurance tied up in my employment so selling them lets me diversify my holdings.
