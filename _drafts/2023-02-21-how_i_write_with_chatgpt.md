[ChatGPT][chatgpt], the new chatbot from [OpenAI][oai], has received
widespread attention for its versatility in conversation, information
retrieval, and even song writing. However, it's tendency to generate false but
believable information has led many to see it as _entertaining_ but not
_useful_.[^edit_1]

But ChatGPT is an **incredibly useful tool** for my writing due to its ability
to rapidly iterate through alternative phrasings for ideas, sentences, and
paragraphs. In this cases, the model's habit of generating false information
is not a concern because I wrote the original input so I know what it should
say, and I can easily edit out any inaccuracies introduced by the
model.[^edit_2]

Let me illustrate how I use ChatGPT to write and copyedit my work.[^edit_3]

## My Writing Process

I start by writing a rough draft which may consists of a few bullet points or
a detailed set of paragraphs. Next, I give it to ChatGPT for refinement.

<strong>Prompt</strong>
<div class="chatgpt-prompt-only" markdown="1">

<div class="chatgpt-output">
<strong>Output</strong>
<div class="chatgpt-output-only" markdown="1">
> 1. I begin my writing process with a rough draft, which may range from a
>    simple list of bullet points to fully developed paragraphs. Next, I input
>    it into ChatGPT.
> 2. My writing method starts with a rough draft - it could be a brief outline
>    or a detailed set of paragraphs. Afterwards, I pass it to ChatGPT.
> 3. To start, I create a preliminary draft - it may consist of a handful of
>    bullet points or fully written paragraphs. Afterwards, I utilize ChatGPT
>    to refine it further.
</div>
</div>

I don't usually take the entire output from ChatGPT, rather I use it to
inspire my own editing:[^edit_4]<sup>, </sup>[^edit_5]

I iterate using this process, refining my text by sending the sections I'm
unhappy with to ChatGPT for improvement until I'm satisfied.[^edit_6]
