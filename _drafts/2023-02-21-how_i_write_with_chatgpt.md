[ChatGPT][chatgpt], the new [large language model][llm] from [OpenAI][oai],
has received widespread attention for its versatility in conversation,
information retrieval, and even song writing. However, it's tendency to
generate false but believable information has led many to see it as
entertaining but not useful.

But ChatGPT is an incredibly useful tool for my writing due to its ability to
rapidly iterate through alternative phrasings for ideas, sentences, and
paragraphs. In these cases, the model's habit of generating false information
is not a concern because I wrote the original input so I know what it should
say, and I can easily edit out any inaccuracies introduced by the model.

Let me illustrate how I use ChatGPT to write and copyedit my work.

## My Writing Process

I start by writing a rough draft which may consists of a few bullet points or
a detailed set of paragraphs. Next, I give it to ChatGPT for refinement.

```
First draft:

I start by writing a rough draft. This draft could be a just a few bullet
points or completely fleshed out paragraphs. I then feed it into chatGPT:

Prompt:

Give me three versions of this paragraph: 

I start by writing a rough draft. This draft could be a just a few bullet points or completely fleshed out paragraphs. I then feed it into chatGPT:

Output:

1. "I begin my writing process with a rough draft, which may range from a
   simple list of bullet points to fully developed paragraphs. Next, I input
   it into ChatGPT."
2. "My writing method starts with a rough draft - it could be a brief outline
   or a detailed set of paragraphs. Afterwards, I pass it to ChatGPT."
3. "To start, I create a preliminary draft - it may consist of a handful of
   bullet points or fully written paragraphs. Afterwards, I utilize ChatGPT to
   refine it further."
```

I don't usually take the entire output from ChatGPT, rather I use it to
inspire my own editing:

### Edit 2

```
First draft:

I generally don't take the full paragraph, but I use ChatGPT's versions to get
ideas for my own:

Prompt:

3 versions of: 

I generally don't take the full paragraph, but I use ChatGPT's versions to get ideas for my own:

Output:

1. "I don't usually use the entire output from ChatGPT, but I do use it as
   inspiration for my own writing."
2. "Typically, I don't adopt ChatGPT's output in its entirety, instead I draw
   ideas from it for my writing."
3. "My approach is not to fully adopt the ChatGPT output, but rather use it to
   spark ideas for my own writing."
```

### Edit 3

draft:


ChatGPT is the new large language model from OpenAI. It has garnered a lot of
attention for its wide range of abilities from conversation to writing songs
to information retrieval. It has also drawn criticism for its habit of making
up plausible but completely wrong facts, leading many to conclude that while
it is entertaining it is not useful.

Output:

1. "OpenAI's ChatGPT is a highly advanced language model that has received
   widespread attention for its diverse abilities, including conversation,
   songwriting, and information retrieval. However, its tendency to generate
   false information that appears credible has led to criticism and the
   conclusion that, although entertaining, it may not be practical."
2. "ChatGPT, the new AI model from OpenAI, has captured considerable attention
   for its wide range of skills, such as conversation, songwriting, and
   information retrieval. Despite this, its propensity for producing
   believable but false facts has sparked criticism, and many view it as
   entertaining but not practical."
3. "OpenAI's ChatGPT, a new and sophisticated language model, has drawn a lot
   of attention for its versatility in conversation, songwriting, and
   information retrieval. Despite this, it has also faced criticism for
   generating seemingly credible but completely false information, leading
   many to see it as entertaining but lacking practicality."

### Edit 4

```

First draft:

I find ChatGPT to be incredibly useful as part of my writing process, because
ChatGPT makes it fast and easy to generate different possible ways to write
down an idea, sentence, or paragraph. In these cases the fact that the model
makes things up is irrelevant because I wrote the original source material so
I can filter out any inaccuracies the model introduces.

<The exact text>

Repsonse:

1. "I consider ChatGPT to be a valuable tool in my writing process due to its
   ability to quickly and effortlessly generate various ways of phrasing an
   idea, sentence, or paragraph. In these cases, the fact that the model
   generates false information is not a concern as I am the originator of the
   source material and can easily identify and remove any inaccuracies
   introduced by the model."
2. "For me, ChatGPT is an extremely useful aspect of my writing as it
   facilitates the rapid creation of alternative phrasings for ideas,
   sentences, or paragraphs. The model's tendency to generate false
   information is inconsequential in these scenarios as I am the source of the
   original material and can easily filter out any inaccuracies introduced by
   the model."
3. "ChatGPT is an indispensable part of my writing process as it enables me to
   quickly generate various ways to express an idea, sentence, or paragraph.
   Its tendency to produce false information is not a problem as I am the
   writer of the original source material, and I can easily eliminate any
   inaccuracies introduced by the model."

### Edit 5

```
Input:

I have ued "tendency" too much already. Rewrite this 5 times, each time only
replacing the word "tendency" with another few words to maintain the meaning:

   pose an issue because I created the original input and can easily remove

   is of no concern as I am the writer of the original material and can
   effectively edit out any inaccuracies introduced by the model.

   these instances as I am aware of the intended content of the original input
   and can efficiently remove any inaccuracies it may introduce.

   these situations as I am familiar with the original input and can
   effortlessly edit out any inaccuracies it generates.
